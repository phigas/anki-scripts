The user has provided a list of words with their readings and an importance score from 0 to 5. My task is to separate them into \"Important\" and \"Not-important\" categories.\n",
      "\n",
      "First, I need to understand the instructions clearly. The user mentioned that some words should be learned directly after the kanji if they are useful or represent important readings. If a word isn't useful or doesn't show an important reading, it should be learned later. Also, each kanji should have at least one important word to learn its most crucial reading.\n",
      "\n",
      "Looking at the list:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. 女 (おんな, 5)\n",
      "2. 女子高生 (じょしこうせい, 3)\n",
      "3. 女性 (じょせい, 3)\n",
      "4. 彼女 (かのじょ, 5)\n",
      "5. 女子 (じょし, 3)\n",
      "6. 少女 (しょうじょ, 4)\n",
      "7. 女の子 (おんなのこ, 5)\n",
      "8. 女の人 (おんなのひと, 5)\n",
      "\n",
      "Each of these words contains the kanji 女. The goal is to determine which ones are important enough to be learned immediately after learning the kanji.\n",
      "\n",
      "Starting with the first word: 女 (おんな, 5). This is a basic word meaning \"woman\" or \"lady.\" Since it's scored as 5, it's definitely an important reading. So this should go in the Important list.\n",
      "\n",
      "Next, 女子高生 (じょしこうせい, 3). This means \"female high school student.\" The score is 3, which is still decent but not top priority. I'm considering whether this word is essential enough for immediate learning. Maybe it's better to learn later if there are more important words.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then, 女性 (じょせい, 3) meaning \"woman\" or \"feminine.\" Another score of 3. It's a common word, but perhaps not as critical as the top ones with higher scores.\n",
      "\n",
      "彼女 (かのじょ, 5) is next. This means \"girlfriend,\" and it has a high importance score of 5. Since it's a frequently used term, especially in conversations about relationships, it should definitely be considered important.\n",
      "\n",
      "Moving on to 女子 (じょし, 3). This means \"woman\" or \"lady,\" similar to the first entry but with a different reading and usage. The score is 3 again. It's another common word, but maybe not as essential as those with higher scores.\n",
      "\n",
      "少女 (しょうじょ, 4) has a score of 4. It means \"young girl.\" This is quite a useful word in many contexts, so it should probably be important.\n",
      "\n",
      "女の子 (おんなのこ, 5) has the highest importance score here at 5. It's another way to say \"girl\" or \"young woman,\" and it's very common. Definitely important.\n",
      "\n",
      "Lastly, 女の人 (おんなのひと, 5). This is another way to refer to a woman, with an importance score of 5. It's quite essential as well.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, I need to decide which words should be in the Important list and which can go later. The user mentioned that each kanji should have at least one important word for its most important reading.\n",
      "\n",
      "Looking at 女, the readings are おんな (from 女), じょしこうせい, じょせい, かのじょ, じょし, しょうじょ, おんなのこ, and おんなの人. The highest scores for each reading would be:\n",
      "\n",
      "- おんな: 5\n",
      "- じょしこうせい: 3\n",
      "- じょせい: 3\n",
      "- かのじょ: 5\n",
      "- じょし: 3\n",
      "- しょうじょ: 4\n",
      "- おんなのこ: 5\n",
      "- おんなの人: 5\n",
      "\n",
      "The most important readings are おんな (女), かのじょ, しょうじょ, おんなのこ, and おんなの人, all with high scores. So these words should be in the Important list because they cover the key readings of 女.\n",
      "\n",
      "The other words, like 女子高生 and 女性, are still useful but perhaps not as critical for immediate learning. However, considering their scores, I might include them if I have space. But to follow the instructions strictly, since some can be learned later, maybe only the top ones go in Important.\n",
      "\n",
      "But looking back, all these words contain the same kanji 女, and they each have different readings that are important for understanding the kanji's various uses. So perhaps it's better to include as many as possible in the Important list if their scores are high enough.\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "1. 下痢 (げり, 1): This is a noun meaning diarrhea. The kanji here are 下 and , but since it's a compound, maybe it's more about knowing the whole word rather than individual kanji. The score is low, so perhaps not important immediately.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. 下 (した, 5): A single kanji meaning below or down. This is pretty basic, so learning this as a standalone is crucial. High importance score, definitely important.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. 下＊げる (さげる, 3): I think the asterisk represents a placeholder for a repeated kanji. So it's \"sa-geru,\" which means to lower or hang down. The score here is 3, so moderately important but maybe not top priority.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. 下手 (へた, 4): Means awkward or inept. Another common word with a moderate importance score of 4, so likely important for learners.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. 下＊る (くだる, 2): This would be \"ku-daru,\" which can mean to come down or be an adjective like delicious. The score is lower at 2, but it's still useful.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. 地下鉄 (ちかてつ, 4): Means subway. Important word for urban vocabulary, with a solid score of 4.\n",
      "\n",
      "7. 下＊さい (ください, 3): This would be \"ku-da-sai,\" which is a polite way to say \"Please give me.\" The score here is 3, and it's useful but maybe not as critical as others.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, considering each kanji:\n",
      "\n",
      "- For the kanji 下, several words use it. The most important reading for 下 is \"した\" (5), so that's essential. Other readings like げり, さげる, へた, etc., might be useful but perhaps secondary.\n",
      "\n",
      "So I should prioritize the word that has the highest score and represents the main reading of the kanji. In this case, 下 (した) is a single kanji with a high importance, so it must go in the important list. The others can be placed as not-important for now unless they offer a unique or crucial reading.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, but some words might teach different readings of the same kanji. For example, 下痢 uses げり, which is another reading of 下. However, since its score is low (1), maybe it's better to learn later. Similarly, other words with lower scores can be deferred.\n",
      "\n",
      "Therefore, the important list should include the most crucial word(s) for each kanji. Since 下 has several readings but the highest score is 5 for した, that's essential. The other words might not add as much value immediately.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, the important list would have 下 (した), and perhaps others if they are necessary for key readings or high scores.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, but looking at the words again, each word has a kanji, but some have multiple kanji like 地下鉄. So I need to consider each individual kanji in each word. For example, 地下鉄 includes 地 and 鉄, but since it's a compound, maybe each of those kanji is already learned elsewhere.\n",
      "\n",
      "But the user's focus is on words that contain certain kanji. So for each word provided, I need to see which kanji are included and whether that word teaches an important reading for that kanji.\n",

      "\n",
      "Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. The user just wants all the provided words sorted into important and not-important lists based on their scores and utility for learning readings. So perhaps I should go by the scores: higher numbers are more important.\n",
      "\n",
      "Looking at the scores:\n",
      "\n",
      "- 下痢 (1)\n",
      "- 下 (5) – highest\n",

      "\n",
      "But wait, I think I might have misordered. Let me list them with scores:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. 下 (した, 5)\n",
      "2. 下手 (へた, 4)\n",

      "6. 下痢 (げり, 1)\n",
      "7. 下＊る (くだる, 2)\n",
      "\n",
      "So the highest is 下 with score 5, then 下手 and 地下鉄 at 4 each, followed by the 3s, then 下＊る at 2, and finally 下痢 at 1.\n",
      "\n",
      "But the user wants to sort the provided words into important and not-important. The key seems to be whether they are useful or represent an important reading for their kanji. So the higher the score, the more likely it's important.\n",
      "\n",
      "Therefore, I think the important list should include the words with scores of 3 and above, except perhaps those that might not add much value. But considering each word:\n",
      "\n",
      "- 下痢 (1): low score, probably not important.\n",
      "- 下 (5): essential, must be important.\n",
      "- 下＊げる (3): useful but maybe secondary.\n",

      "\n",
      "Looking at 否 (いな), I know that \"ina\" is a less common reading. It's used in words like 不可否 (ふかほ) meaning possibility or impossibility. But on its own, \"ina\" isn't widely used. So maybe this should be not-important because it's not the primary or most useful reading for the kanji.\n",
      "\n",
      "Next, 拒否 (きょひ) is a common word meaning refusal or denial. The reading \"kyohi\" directly uses the first kanji 否 and the second 拒. Since this word is quite useful and represents an important usage of both kanji, it should be marked as important.\n",
      "\n",
      "否定形 (ひていけい) refers to the negative form in grammar. It's a specific term used in language studies. The reading \"hiteikei\" uses 否定, which combines 否 and 定.

      "\n",
      "- For 否: The readings are いな and ひてい/きょひ etc. Since 拒否 uses きょひ which includes 否 but in a compound, I think 否 itself might not have a primary reading that's crucial on its own. So the word 否 (いな) could be considered less important.\n",

      "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how to sort these Japanese words into important and not-important categories for flashcards based on the user's instructions. Let me break down what they said.\n",
      "\n",
      "First, the user provided a single word: 液晶 (えきしょう, 1). The importance score is 1 out of 5, which I guess means it's less important. My task is to determine if this word should be considered important or not when creating flashcards for its kanji.\n",
      "\n",
      "The instructions mention that some words are learned directly after the kanji if they're useful and represent important readings. If a word isn't useful or doesn't show an important reading, it should be learned later. So I need to assess whether 液晶 is one of those key words that teaches a crucial reading for its kanji.\n",
      "\n",
      "液晶 (えきしょう) means liquid crystal in English. Now, the kanji here are 液 (けい, えき) and 晶 (しょう). The word uses the readings えき and しょう together. Since this is a compound word combining these two kanji, it's likely that each kanji contributes to the meaning but isn't necessarily standalone.\n",
      "\n",
      "I should think about whether 液晶 is a commonly used word or if it's more specialized. Liquid crystal displays are common in technology, so maybe 液晶 is a useful term in modern contexts. However, considering the importance score of 1, which is low, perhaps it's not as essential as higher-scored words might be.\n",
      "\n",
      "The user also mentioned that at least one word should always be important to learn the most important reading. In this case, though, since there's only one word provided and its score is low, I need to decide if it still counts as important enough.\n",
      "\n",
      "I think about whether 液晶 teaches a crucial reading for either of its kanji. The kanji 液 can also be read as けい in some compounds, but 涉 (like in 涉る) uses せつ or しょう. Wait, no, 涉 is different. Maybe 晶 can be read as しょう, which is used in other words like 星 (ほし, せい, しょう). So perhaps the reading しょう for 晶 is important and might be better taught through another word with a higher importance score.\n",
      "\n",
      "Given that the score is 1, it's on the lower end. Maybe it's not the best example to teach either kanji's primary readings. Therefore, it might make more sense to categorize this as not-important so that flashcards can focus on other words first, which better represent crucial readings and are more useful in general.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, after considering all this, I decide to put 液晶 in the Not-important list because it's less commonly used and has a lower importance score, making it suitable for learning later once more important words are covered.\n",

The user has provided a list of words along with their readings and importance scores. Each word includes a kanji, which is crucial because the task is about learning both the kanji and associated vocabulary.\n",
      "\n",
      "First, I need to understand the criteria given. Words that are learned directly after the kanji should only be those that are useful or represent important readings. If a word isn't useful or doesn't show an important reading, it's better to learn it later. The user mentioned that all words might be classified as important, but for less important kanji, it's okay to have fewer important words. However, at least one word should always be important to cover the most important reading of the kanji.\n",
      "\n",
      "Looking at the example response, \"泳*ぐ (およぐ, 4)\" was placed in the important list. The score is out of 5, with higher numbers indicating greater importance. So I should consider both the score and whether the word provides a key reading for its kanji.\n",
      "\n",
      "I need to think about each word provided:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. 泳*ぐ (およぐ, 4)\n",
      "2. 一*つ (ひとつ, 4)\n",
      "3. 犬* (いぬ, 5)\n",
      "4. 電*車 (でんしゃ, 4)\n",
      "\n",
      "Starting with 泳*ぐ: The kanji is 泳, which means \"to swim.\" The reading is およぐ, and the score is 4. This seems like a common word for swimming, so it's useful.\n",
      "\n",
      "Next, 一*つ: The kanji here is 一, meaning \"one.\" The reading is ひとつ, which is a fundamental number used in counting objects. Since numbers are essential in Japanese, this should be important.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then, 犬*: The kanji is 犬, meaning \"dog,\" and the reading is いぬ. This is another basic word that's commonly used, so it's important for learning the kanji 犬.\n",
      "\n",
      "Lastly, 電*車: The kanji here is 電, which relates to electricity or electric. The reading is でんしゃ, meaning \"electric car.\" While this is a useful word, especially in modern contexts with more electric vehicles, it might be slightly less essential compared to the others. However, considering the score is still high (4), I need to decide if it's important enough to include now or save for later.\n",
      "\n",
      "The user mentioned that all words could be considered important but to prioritize based on utility and importance of readings. Given that 一*つ, 犬*, and 泳*ぐ are more fundamental in terms of usage and kanji readings, they should be in the important list. 電*車 is still useful but might be a good candidate for later learning if needed.\n",
      "\n",
      "I'm leaning towards including all four as important because each contributes significantly to understanding their respective kanji, even though 電*车 might be slightly less common. Alternatively, if I need to separate them, maybe only the top three go into important and 電*车 goes into not-important, but since it's a 4/5 score, which is quite high, it's better to include it as important.\n",

      "<think>\n",
      "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how to sort these Japanese words into important and not-important categories based on their readings and importance scores. Let me start by understanding the problem.\n",
      "\n",
      "The user has provided a list of five words with their readings and an importance score. Each word contains a certain kanji, and the task is to decide which words should be learned directly after the kanji (important) and which should be learned later (not-important). \n",
      "\n",
      "First, I need to analyze each word individually. Let's look at them one by one.\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **明*るい (あかるい, 5)**: The kanji here is 明 with a reading of *るい. The importance score is 5, which is the highest. This seems very important because it's a high score and likely a common usage of the kanji 明.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **説明 (せつめい, 4)**: The kanji here are 説 and 明. The reading is せつめい, and the importance score is 4. Since this is a compound word with two kanji, it's probably useful but maybe not as critical as others.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **明＊らか (あきらか, 2)**: Here, the kanji 明 has an alternative reading of ＊らか. The importance score is 2, which is lower. This might be a less common or less important usage of the same kanji.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **不明 (ふめい, 2)**: Another word with 明, but this time it's part of 不明. The reading is ふめい, and the score is 2. Again, not as high as others.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **明けましておめでとう (あけましておめでとう!, 1)**: This seems like a phrase used on New Year's, specifically for greeting. The importance score is 1, which is low. It might be more of a cultural expression rather than a standard vocabulary word.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, the user mentioned that words learned directly after the kanji should only be those that are useful and represent important readings. Also, each kanji must have at least one important word if possible, especially for the most important reading.\n",
      "\n",
      "Looking at the kanji 明, it's present in all these words except 説明 (which uses 説 as well). Wait, no—actually, 説明 has two kanji: 説 and 明. So each of these words is associated with either 明 or other kanji.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, perhaps I need to consider the primary kanji for each word. For example:\n",
      "\n",
      "- 明*るい (あかるい): Focuses on the kanji 明.\n",
      "- 説明 (せつめい): Both 説 and 明 are important here.\n",
      "- 明＊らか (あきらか): Again, 明 is the focus.\n",
      "- 不明 (ふめい): 明 again.\n",
      "- 明けましておめでとう: 明 is the key kanji.\n",
      "\n",
      "So for each of these words, we're looking at their contribution to the readings of their respective kanji. The goal is to select which words should be learned immediately after learning the kanji based on their utility and importance.\n",
      "\n",
      "The highest score is 5 for 明*るい (あかるい). Since it's a high score and likely teaches an important reading of 明, this should definitely be in the important list. \n",
      "\n",
      "説明 has a score of 4, which is still quite high, but since it involves two kanji, perhaps it's better to include it if it teaches both readings effectively. However, I'm not sure if it's more efficient to learn each kanji separately or together.\n",
      "\n",
      "The other words have lower scores (2 and 1). 明＊らか with a score of 2 is still somewhat useful but maybe less critical than the higher ones. 不明 also has a score of 2, which might be useful in certain contexts but perhaps not as essential.\n",
      "\n",
      "The last one has a score of 1, so it's likely not crucial for immediate learning after the kanji.\n",
      "\n",
      "I think the key here is to prioritize words with higher importance scores and those that teach important readings of their kanji. Since 明*るい (5) is the highest, it should be included in important. 説明 (4) is also quite high, so it's a candidate for important as well.\n",
      "\n",
      "The others have lower scores, so they might go into not-important. However, I need to ensure that at least one word per kanji is important, especially if it teaches the most common reading.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, but all these words are related to 明 except 説明. So for the kanji 明, we should have at least one important word. Since 明*るい (あかるい) has the highest score and likely represents a primary reading, that's essential. 説明 also uses 明 but as part of another compound.\n",
      "\n",
      "So perhaps:\n",
      "\n",
      "Important: 明*るい, 説明\n",
      "Not-important: 明＊らか, 不明, 明けましておめでとう\n",
      "\n",
      "But I'm not sure if 説明 should be in important or not. Since it's a 4/5 score and teaches two kanji, maybe it's better to include it as important.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alternatively, since the user mentioned that some words are learned directly after the kanji and others later, perhaps only those that are essential for the primary readings of their respective kanji should be in the important list. So 明*るい is essential for 明, 説明 might be more about 説 than 明.\n",
      "\n",
      "But I'm a bit confused because 説明 uses both kanji. Maybe it's better to include both.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alternatively, perhaps only one word per kanji needs to be in the important list if that word teaches the most critical reading.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, the user said: \"the words that are learned directly after the kanji should only be words that are useful and words that represent important readings.\" So for each kanji, we need at least one word that's important.\n",
      "\n",
      "Since all these words except 説明 focus on 明, but 説明 uses another kanji (説) as well. So perhaps:\n",
      "\n",
      "For the kanji 明: include 明*るい and possibly 不明 or 明＊らか? But since they have lower scores, maybe only 明*るい is essential.\n",
      "\n",
      "But I'm not sure if that's the right approach. Alternatively, consider each word's score and utility regardless of the kanji.\n",
      "\n",
      "Given that, perhaps:\n",
      "\n",
      "Important: 明*るい (5), 説明 (4)\n",
      "Not-important: 明＊らか (2), 不明 (2), 明けましておめでとう (1)\n",
      "\n",
      "But I'm not entirely sure if this is correct. It's possible that the lower-scored words should be in the not-important list, but maybe some of them are still useful.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alternatively, perhaps only the highest score per kanji goes into important, and others go to not-important.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, the user also said: \"All words may be classified as important. But for less important kanji it is acceptable to have less important words. Although at least one word should always be important to learn the most important reading of the word.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "So each kanji must have at least one important word that teaches its main reading.\n",
      "\n",
      "Looking back, 明*るい (あかるい) seems to teach an important reading of 明, so it's essential in important. 説明 also has 明 but paired with 説; maybe not as critical for learning the primary readings.\n",
      "\n",
      "Therefore, I think:\n",
      "\n",
      "Important: 明*るい, 説明\n",

      "First, I see that all the provided words contain certain kanji, which means each word is linked to specific characters. My task is to determine which of these should be learned immediately after the kanji (important) and which can be learned later (not-important). \n",
      "\n",
      "The list given is:\n",
      "- 朝刊 (ちょうかん, 1)\n",
      "- 朝日 (あさひ, 2)\n",
      "- 朝 (あさ, 5)\n",
      "- 朝ごはん (あさごはん, 4)\n",
      "\n",
      "Each has an importance score from 0 to 5. I need to decide which words should be considered important for learning the kanji's readings.\n",
      "\n",
      "Starting with 朝刊: The reading is \"ちょうかん,\" and the importance score is 1. This word means morning newspaper. Since newspapers are a common context, but maybe not as essential as other terms. \n",
      "\n",
      "Next is 朝日: Reading \"あさひ,\" importance score 2. It refers to the morning sun or the Asahi newspaper (a major publication). The newspaper part might be useful.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then there's 朝: Reading \"あさ,\" and a high importance score of 5. This is just the word for morning, which is fundamental. Knowing this kanji alone is crucial because it's a basic term used daily.\n",
      "\n",
      "Lastly, 朝ごはん: Reading \"あさごはん,\" importance score 4. It means breakfast, specifically in the morning. Breakfast is a common context and useful for everyday language.\n",
      "\n",
      "I need to decide which words represent important readings that should be learned right after the kanji. The most important reading is usually the one that's the most fundamental or commonly used.\n",
      "\n",
      "Looking at the scores, 朝 (あさ) has the highest score of 5, making it essential to learn first. It represents the basic meaning of \"morning\" and is a standalone kanji, so knowing this word helps in understanding other compound words with the same kanji.\n",
      "\n",
      "Next, 朝日: The reading \"あさひ\" might be less common than just \"あさ.\" Since it's part of both a newspaper and the sun, but maybe not as essential on its own. It has a score of 2, lower than 朝.\n",
      "\n",
      "朝刊 with a score of 1 is probably used in specific contexts like newspapers, so it's good but not critical for immediate learning.\n",
      "\n",
      "朝ごはん has a score of 4, which is high. It's a common word referring to breakfast, so it's useful and likely more frequently used than the others except for 朝 itself.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, since 朝 (あさ) is already covering the basic meaning, maybe learning another compound like 朝日 or 朝ごはん would be better for reinforcing the kanji. But according to the instructions, at least one word should always be important to learn the most important reading.\n",
      "\n",
      "I think 朝 (あさ) must be in the important list because it's the highest score and represents the core meaning. For the other words, 朝日 is a compound that might not be as immediately useful, but 朝ごはん is quite common. \n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, no—since each word contains certain kanji, I need to think about which words teach the important readings of their respective kanji. But all these words use the same initial kanji \"朝\" plus others.\n",
      "\n",
      "So maybe the approach is that for each kanji, if a word uses it and provides an important reading, it should be in the important list. However, since all words here are different but share the \"朝\" kanji, perhaps I'm misunderstanding. \n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, no—the user said \"All words contain a certain kanji.\" So maybe each word has its own kanji(s). Let me clarify: 朝刊 is made of 朝 and 刊; 朝日 is 朝 and 日; 朝 is just 朝; 朝ごはん is 朝, ご, and 是?\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait no—probably 朝 is the main kanji in all these words. So each word uses the 朝 kanji plus others.\n",
      "\n",
      "The task is to sort the provided words into important and not-important based on whether they should be learned immediately after the kanji for their readings or can be learned later.\n",
      "\n",
      "Given that, I think the most useful words are those with high importance scores and which are likely to teach important readings of the kanji. \n",
      "\n",
      "朝 (あさ) has a score of 5 and is essential as it's the standalone word for morning. It should definitely be in the important list.\n",
      "\n",
      "朝ごはん (4) is also very common, so it's useful but perhaps not as crucial as the standalone 朝. However, since both are using the same kanji, maybe including both would help reinforce the readings, but according to the instructions, only some should be immediately learned.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, I'm getting a bit confused here. Let me think again: The user wants to create flashcards where some words are learned right after the kanji if they're useful and represent important readings. Others can wait.\n",
      "\n",
      "So for each word, I need to assess whether it's essential enough to learn early based on its utility and how it represents an important reading of its kanji(s).\n",
      "\n",
      "Considering that 朝 (あさ) is a standalone word with high importance, it should be in the important list. \n",
      "\n",
      "朝日 (あさひ) has a score of 2 but uses two kanji: 朝 and 日. The reading \"あさひ\" might not be as commonly used on its own compared to just 朝 or other compounds like 朝ごはん.\n",
      "\n",
      "朝刊 (ちょうかん, 1): This is a compound with 刊, which means publication. It's specific to newspapers. Maybe less immediately useful than the others.\n",
      "\n",
      "朝ごはん (あさごはん, 4) uses 朝 and is about breakfast, a common context. So it's quite useful.\n",
      "\n",
      "But wait, does each word use its own kanji? Or are they all using \"朝\" plus other kanji? The user said all words contain a certain kanji, so perhaps each word has one or more kanji, but for the purpose of learning the readings, we're focusing on which words teach important readings.\n",
      "\n",
      "In that case, 朝 (あさ) is critical because it's the basic meaning. Without knowing this, other compounds might be harder to grasp. So it should definitely be in the important list.\n",
      "\n",
      "For the others:\n",
      "- 朝日: The reading \"あさひ\" is a common word for morning sun or the Asahi newspaper.\n",
      "- 朝刊: Refers to the morning edition of a newspaper.\n",
      "- 朝ごはん: Breakfast.\n",
      "\n",
      "Between these, 朝ごはん has a higher importance score (4) than 朝日 (2), so it might be more important. \n",
      "\n",
      "However, since all these words share the same initial kanji \"朝,\" maybe including both could help in understanding different readings and compounds. But according to the instructions, I should only include those that are useful and represent important readings.\n",
      "\n",
      "Given that, I think 朝 and 朝ごはん should be in the important list because they have higher scores and are more commonly used. 朝刊 is also about newspapers but has a lower score, so maybe it's not as critical. \n",
      "\n",
      "Wait no—the user said to respond with the kanji of the word. Wait, no, that's for the flashcards: when creating them, you return the words based on their status.\n",
      "\n",
      "But in this case, I'm just sorting the given list into important and not-important. So the actual task is to decide which of these four words are important enough to learn right after the kanji, considering their readings and importance scores.\n",
      "\n",
      "Given that 朝 has a high score (5), it must be included. Then, looking at the others:\n",
      "\n",
      "- 朝日: Score 2, but perhaps not as immediately useful as 朝ごはん.\n",
      "- 朝ごはん: Score 4, very common.\n",
      "- 朝刊: Score 1.\n",
      "\n",
      "So I think 朝 and 朝ごはん should be in important. But wait, the user said \"the words that are going to teach you an important reading of a kanji.\" So for each word, does it contain a kanji whose important reading is taught by that word?\n",
      "\n",
      "For example:\n",
      "\n",
      "- 朝 (あさ) teaches the reading 'asa' for the kanji 朝.\n",
      "- 朝日: Also uses 朝 and 日. The reading 'asahi' includes 朝's 'asa' and 日's 'hi'.\n",
      "- 朝刊: Uses 朝 and 刊, with readings 'asakai' (for 刊? Wait no—朝刊 is read 'acho kai'? No, wait: 朝刊 is pronounced 'cho-kai'? Or 'asaka-n'?\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me check:\n",
      "\n",
      "- 朝 (あさ) is read 'asa'.\n",
      "- 朝日 (asahi) uses 朝 (asa) and 日 (hi).\n",
      "- 朝刊 is asakkan? No, actually, 朝刊 is pronounced 'cho-kai'? Or 'asak kan'?\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, no—I think 朝刊 is 'sa-kaban' or something. Wait, I'm not sure about the readings.\n",
      "\n",
      "Actually, in Japanese, 朝刊 is read 'sa-kabin'? Or is it 'acho kan'? No, wait: 朝刊 is 'cho kai'. Let me confirm:\n",
      "\n",
      "- 朝刊 (ちょうかん): Choukan, where 朝 is 'cho' and 刊 is 'kan'.\n",
      "\n",
      "So in this case, the word 朝刊 teaches the reading 'cho' for 朝 and 'kan' for 刊.\n",
      "\n",
      "Similarly, 朝日 is Asahi: 朝 is 'asa' and 日 is 'hi'.\n",
      "\n",
      "And 朝ごはん is 'asagohan', which is a common word for breakfast.\n",
      "\n",
      "So considering that:\n",
      "\n",
      "- The standalone 朝 (asa) is essential because it's the basic reading.\n",
      "- 朝日 teaches another compound using 朝, but perhaps not as critical as the standalone.\n",
      "- 朝刊 teaches a different compound with 刊, which might be less common.\n",
      "- 朝ごはん is very commonly used and teaches 'asagohan', which includes 朝.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, in terms of importance for learning readings:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. 朝 (asa) - essential standalone reading.\n",
      "2. 朝ごはん (asagohan) - high utility word.\n",
      "3. 朝日 (asahi) - also useful but maybe not as critical.\n",
      "4. 朝刊 (cho-kai) - perhaps less common.\n",
      "\n",
      "Therefore, I think both 朝 and 朝ごはん should be in the important list because they teach essential readings and are highly useful. The other two can go into not-important.\n",
      "\n",
      "But wait, the user said \"the words that are going to teach you an important reading of a kanji.\" So each word may have one or more kanji, but we need to focus on whether it teaches an important reading for any of its kanji.\n",
      "\n",
      "For example:\n",
      "\n",
      "- 朝 (asa) - teaches 'asa' for 朝.\n",
      "- 朝日 - teaches 'asa' and 'hi', but since 'asa' is already taught by the standalone 朝, maybe this word isn't as critical unless it's teaching another reading.\n",
      "- 朝ごはん - teaches 'asagohan', which includes 'asa' and 'gohan'.\n",
      "- 朝刊 - teaches 'cho' for 朝 and 'kan' for 刊.\n",
      "\n",
      "So if we're considering the readings, both 朝 and 朝刊 teach different readings of 朝: 'asa' and 'cho'. Therefore, including both would help learn both readings. But is 'cho' an important reading? It depends on frequency.\n",
      "\n",
      "But given the importance scores:\n",
      "\n",
      "- 朝 has a high score (5), so definitely include.\n",
      "- 朝ごはん has a higher score (4) than 朝刊 (1). So perhaps 朝 and 朝ごはん should be in important, while 朝日 and 朝刊 go to not-important.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alternatively, since 朝 is the core kanji here, focusing on its primary reading 'asa' via 朝 makes sense. The compound readings like 'cho' in 朝刊 might come later.\n",
      "\n",
      "Therefore, I think:\n",
      "\n",
      "Important: 朝, 朝ごはん\n",
      "\n",
      "Not important: 朝日, 朝刊\n",
      "\n",
      "But wait, the user's instruction was to sort the words into those that should be learned immediately after the kanji (important) and those that can be learned later (not-important). So for each word, determine if it teaches an important reading.\n",
      "\n",
      "Given that:\n",
      "\n",
      "- 朝 is a standalone word teaching 'asa' for 朝.\n",
      "- 朝日 uses 'asa' again but adds 'hi' for 日. Since 'asa' is already covered by 朝, maybe not critical unless 日's 'hi' is essential.\n",
      "- 朝ごはん teaches 'asagohan', which includes 'asa' and introduces 'gohan' (related to food).\n",
      "- 朝刊 teaches 'cho' for 朝 and 'kan' for 刊.\n",
      "\n",
      "Assuming that the primary reading of 朝 is 'asa', then 朝 is essential. The compound readings like 'cho' might be less critical unless they're very common.\n",
      "\n",
      "Therefore, perhaps only 朝 should be in important, and others can go to not-important. But 朝ごはん is a high-frequency word, so maybe it's better to include it as well because it reinforces 'asa'.\n",
      "\n",
      "I think I'll settle on:\n",
      "\n",
      "Important: 朝, 朝ごはん\n",

      "Okay, so I need to sort these Japanese words based on their importance for creating flashcards. The user provided some specific instructions about which words should be learned directly after the kanji and which ones should be saved for later. Let me try to understand this step by step.\n",
      "\n",
      "First, each entry has a kanji, its reading, and an importance score from 0 to 5. My task is to separate these into two lists: Important and Not-important. The words that are learned immediately after the kanji should only be those that are useful or represent important readings. If a word isn't useful or doesn't show an important reading, it goes into the Not-important list.\n",
      "\n",
      "The user mentioned that all words might be classified as important, but for less important kanji, it's okay to have fewer important words. However, there should always be at least one important word to cover the most crucial reading of the kanji.\n",
      "\n",
      "Let me look at each entry provided:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. 胃 (い, 2): The kanji is 胃, which means stomach. The reading is \"い\" with an importance score of 2. Since it's a basic vocabulary word related to health and medical terms, I think this should be important.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. 一番 (いちばん, 5): This is a common word meaning \"first\" or \"most.\" The high importance score suggests it's very useful, so it definitely goes into Important.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. 犬 (いぬ, 4): Meaning dog, and with a high score of 4, this is another important word that should be learned immediately.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. 電話 (でんわ, 3): Telephone, also quite common, so important as well.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. 時間 (じかん, 2): Time, which is essential vocabulary; definitely important.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. 学校 (がっこう, 5): School, a very common word with a high score; important.\n",
      "\n",
      "7. 火曜日 (かようび, 3): Tuesday, useful for days of the week but perhaps less critical than others? The importance score is 3, which is still quite high, so I think it should be important.\n",
      "\n",
      "8. 本 (ほん, 4): Book or volume; a very common word with a high score; definitely important.\n",
      "\n",
      "9. 静か (しずか, 4): Quiet, another useful adjective; important.\n",
      "\n",
      "10. 必要 (ひつよう, 3): Necessary, important for expressing necessity; should be in Important.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, but the user specified to sort the words based on their importance and whether they represent important readings of the kanji. So maybe I need to consider if the word's reading is a primary or secondary reading.\n",
      "\n",
      "For example, 胃 (い) primarily reads as い, so the word 胃 itself should be important. For 一番 (いちばん), it's a single kanji with multiple readings but in this case, the main reading is いちばん, which is important.\n",
      "\n",
      "Looking again, all these words have high importance scores and are essential for daily vocabulary. So perhaps all of them should go into Important, except maybe none? Wait, no—the user said some can be Not-important if they aren't useful or don't represent an important reading.\n",
      "\n",
      "But in this case, all the readings provided seem to be primary or at least highly used. Each word is either a common noun, verb, or adjective with high utility in Japanese.\n",

      "Wait, perhaps I should consider if any of these words have less common readings that are not as crucial. For example, if a kanji has multiple readings and only one is important, then the word representing that reading should be in Important. The others might go to Not-important. But in this list, each entry seems to be just one reading.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, but the user didn't provide multiple readings for any kanji here, so perhaps all these are single readings, making them all important. However, I need to consider if some words are less commonly used or have lower importance scores.\n",
      "\n",
      "Looking at their importance scores:\n",
      "\n",
      "- 胃 (2): Lower than others but still 2/5.\n",
      "- 一番 (5): Very high.\n",
      "- 犬 (4): High.\n",
      "- 電話 (3): Moderate-high.\n",
      "- 時間 (2): Lower, but still 2.\n",
      "- 学校 (5): Very high.\n",
      "- 火曜日 (3): Moderate-high.\n",

      "- 静か (4): High.\n",
      "- 必要 (3): Moderate-high.\n",
      "\n",
      "Given that all have at least a score of 2 and most are higher, I think they should all be in Important. There's no word here with such a low importance score or reading that isn't essential. So maybe all go to Important, and Not-important would be empty?\n",
      "\n",
      "But the user said \"some\" will be learned later, so perhaps I need to identify which ones are less critical. Maybe words like 火曜日 (days of the week can sometimes be taught later) but it's a score of 3, which isn't too low.\n",

      "Okay, I need to help sort these Japanese words into important and not-important categories based on their readings and importance scores. The user has provided six words, each with their kanji, reading, and an importance score from 0 to 5.\n",
      "\n",
      "First, let me list them out clearly:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. 筋肉 (きんにく, 3)\n",
      "2. 豚肉 (ぶたにく, 3)\n",
      "3. 肉 (にく, 4)\n",

However, even less important kanji can have less important words, but at least one word per kanji must be important to cover the most important reading.\n",
      "\n",
      "Let me analyze each word:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. 筋肉 (きんにく) - Reading: きんにく. Importance score is 3.\n",
      "   - This means \"meat\" in a specific context, maybe related to muscles or animal meat? The kanji 肉 is part of it. The reading is きんにく.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. 豚肉 (ぶたにく) - Reading: ぶたにく. Importance score 3.\n",
      "   - \"Pork meat.\" Common word, especially in food contexts.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. 肉 (にく) - Reading: にく. Importance score 4.\n",
      "   - The basic word for \"meat\" as a whole, fundamental. High importance score of 4 suggests it's crucial to learn this.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. 焼肉 (やきにく) - Reading: やきにく. Importance score 2.\n",
      "   - \"Grilled meat,\" a common term in Japanese cuisine, especially for BBQ restaurants. Moderate importance.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. 牛肉 (ぎゅうにく) - Reading: ぎゅうにく. Importance score 2.\n",
      "   - \"Beef.\" Another fundamental meat category but with a slightly lower importance score than 肉.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. 皮肉 (ひにく) - Reading: ひにく. Importance score 3.\n",
      "   - \"Pork skin\" or the skin part of meat, used in dishes like tonkatsu.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, I need to decide which of these should be considered important and which not. The key is that each kanji's primary reading should be covered by an important word.\n",
      "\n",
      "Looking at 肉: it appears in all words except 皮肉 (where it's part of the compound). However, the main kanji to focus on might be the ones that are standalone or more fundamental.\n",
      "\n",
      "- 肉 itself is a single kanji and has high importance (4), so it should definitely be important.\n",
      "- 筋肉: The kanji here are 筋 (きん) and 肉 (にく). Since 肉 is already covered by the word 肉, maybe this can be not-important or considered later. But its score is 3, which isn't too low. However, considering that learning 筋肉 might be useful for the reading of 肉 as well, but since 肉 itself is more fundamental, perhaps 筋肉 can be placed in not-important.\n",
      "- 豚肉: The kanji are 豚 (ぶた) and 肉 (にく). Since 肉 is important, but 豚 on its own might not be as critical. However, the word itself has a high score of 3, so maybe it's better to include it in important.\n",
      "- 無肉: The kanji are 焼 (やき) and 肉 (にく). 焼 is often used with 肉 for 焼肉, which is a common word. But the importance score is 2, so maybe not as crucial but still useful.\n",
      "- 牛肉: The kanji are 牛 (ぎゅう) and 肉 (にく). Important for beef, but again, with a lower score of 2. However, 牛 might be another standalone kanji to consider, but the user is focusing on words, not individual kanji here.\n",
      "- 皮肉: The kanji are 皮 (ひ) and 肉 (にく). This is more specific, so perhaps it can be placed in not-important.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, but the task isn't about individual kanji but the words themselves. So each word should be evaluated based on its own importance and whether it's a useful reading for its kanji.\n",
      "\n",
      "Given that:\n",
      "\n",
      "- 肉 (4) is very important because it's the basic term.\n",
      "- 筋肉 (3): Since 肉 is already covered, maybe this can be not-important, but it might still be useful for learning another reading or context.\n",
      "- 豚肉 (3): Also a common word with a high score. Including it as important would cover the 豚 reading and reinforce 肉.\n",
      "- 無肉 (2): Grilled meat is quite common, so even though the score is lower, it might still be useful.\n",
      "- 牛肉 (2): Beef is another fundamental category but slightly less critical than pork or general meat.\n",
      "- 皮肉 (3): More specific, perhaps better as not-important.\n",
      "\n",
      "But I need to ensure that at least one word per kanji's primary reading is important. However, since some of these words share the same kanji, like 肉 appearing in multiple words, maybe it's sufficient to have 肉 itself as important, and others can be placed accordingly.\n",
      "\n",
      "Let me try to categorize:\n",
      "\n",
      "Important:\n",
      "- 筋肉 (3): The reading きんにく is important for the context of muscle meat. Even though 肉 is covered by another word, this might add value.\n",
      "- 豚肉 (3): Important for pork and reinforces 肉.\n",
      "- 牛肉 (2): Important for beef.\n",
      "\n",
      "Not-important:\n",
      "- 無肉 (2)\n",
      "- 皮肉 (3)\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, but the user wants two lists: Important and Not-important. Let me make sure I'm not missing any critical words. The highest score is 4 for 肉, which should definitely be important. Then, the others are either in meat categories or specific terms.\n",
      "\n",
      "But according to the initial response provided, it was:\n",
      "\n",
      "Important: 筋肉 豚肉 肉 牛肉\n",
      "Not-important: 無肉 皮肉\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, that seems conflicting because it includes all but two as important. Maybe I need to check again.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alternatively, perhaps only the highest importance words are considered important, and the rest go into not-important. But given the scores, 肉 is 4, which is high; 筋肉, 豚肉, and 皮肉 are 3; while 無肉 and 牛肉 are 2.\n",
      "\n",
      "So perhaps:\n",
      "\n",
      "Important: 筋肉 (3), 豚肉 (3), 肉 (4), 牛肉 (2)\n",
      "\n",
      "Not-important: 無肉 (2), 皮肉 (3)\n",
      "\n",
      "But that includes more than two lists, but the user's response format was to have Important and Not-important with words separated by spaces.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alternatively, perhaps only the top few are important. Let me think about which readings are essential for each kanji.\n",
      "\n",
      "The main kanji in these words are:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. 筋肉: 筋 (ki) and 肉 (nuku)\n",
      "2. 豚肉: 豚 (buta) and 肉 (nuku)\n",
      "3. 肉: nuku\n",
      "4. 無肉: 焼 (yaki) and 肉 (nuku)\n",
      "5. 牛肉: 牛 (gyu) and 肉 (nuku)\n",
      "6. 皮肉: 皮 (pi) and 肉 (nuku)\n",
      "\n",
      "Since 肉 is the core kanji in most words, and it's covered by the word 肉 itself, which has the highest score, perhaps only that needs to be important. The others can be considered based on their usage.\n",
      "\n",
      "But considering that each word includes a different kanji alongside 肉, maybe all of them are important for learning those specific combinations.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, given the scores:\n",
      "\n",
      "- 肉 (4) is essential.\n",
      "- 筋肉 (3), 豚肉 (3), 皮肉 (3): All have high scores and are specific terms that might be useful for their respective kanji.\n",
      "- 無肉 (2), 牛肉 (2): Slightly lower but still relevant.\n",
      "\n",
      "So perhaps all except the lowest could be important, but I need to adhere to the user's initial example where they included four in important and two in not-important. Alternatively, maybe only the highest scores are considered important.\n",
      "\n",
      "But without clear guidelines on how many should go into each category, it's a bit ambiguous. However, based on the initial response provided by the user when they wrote this thought process, perhaps the correct categorization is:\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "3. **目的 (もくてき, 4)**: This means \"purpose\" or \"goal.\" It's a high-frequency word and the reading is quite important for understanding context in various situations. The score of 4 suggests it's very useful.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **目立つ (めだつ, 3)**: Meaning \"stand out\" or \"prominent,\" this is also quite common and useful in daily conversation. The score here is 3, which is decent but not the highest.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **駄目 (だめ, 3)**: This means \"no good\" or \"useless.\" It's a negative expression that can be useful but might not be as commonly used as others with higher scores.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. **目次 (もくじ, 2)**: Translating to \"table of contents,\" this is more specialized and less frequently used in everyday conversation. The score is lower at 2, indicating it's perhaps less critical for immediate learning.\n",
      "\n",
      "7. **目撃者 (もくげきしゃ, 0)**: Meaning \"witness,\" this has a very low importance score of 0. It seems highly specialized and probably not essential to learn immediately.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, considering the guidelines: words learned directly after kanji should be useful and represent important readings. The user mentioned that at least one word should always be important to cover the most crucial reading. \n",

      "- **目**: The basic meaning is \"eye,\" which is fundamental. Learning 目 itself is essential, but none of the provided words for 目 have the reading \"め\" except as part of compound words. However, since all the words are compounds of 目, perhaps the key here is to ensure that at least one word with an important reading is included.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait a second, I might be misunderstanding. The user said each word contains a certain kanji, so each word is tied to its own kanji. So for example, 番目 is associated with 番 (ばん), and 目的 is associated with 目 (め). Wait, no—actually, looking at the list again:\n",
      "\n",
      "- 目: kanji is 目\n",
      "- 番目: kanji is 番\n",
      "- 目的: kanji is 目\n",
      "- 目立つ: kanji is 目\n",
      "- 駄目: kanji is 駄\n",
      "- 目次: kanji is 目\n",
      "- 目撃者: kanji is 目\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, no. Each word is associated with a certain kanji. So for example, 目的 is 〜め, which relates to the kanji 目 (same as the first entry). Similarly, 番目 is 〜ばんめ, and its kanji is 番.\n",
      "\n",
      "So perhaps I need to look at each kanji separately. The user provided words that contain a certain kanji, so for example:\n",
      "\n",
      "- For the kanji 目: there are multiple readings (め, ばんめ, もくてき, etc.) but the important score applies to the word itself.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, actually, looking back, the initial list includes words with their own kanji. So each entry is a separate word with its own kanji and reading(s). For example:\n",
      "\n",
      "- 目 (kanji: 目) with readings 〜め\n",
      "- 番目 (kanji: 番 and 目) with reading ばんめ\n",
      "- 目的 (kanji: 目 and 的) with reading もくてき\n",
      "- etc.\n",
      "\n",
      "So each word is tied to its own specific kanji, even though some words might share the same kanji as others. Therefore, I need to treat each word's importance based on its own merit.\n",
      "\n",
      "Given that, let's reevaluate:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **目 (め, 5)**: As a standalone kanji with high importance, it should be important.\n",
      "2. **番目 (ばんめ, 3)**: Useful but maybe not as crucial as higher-scored words.\n",
      "3. **目的 (もくてき, 4)**: Very useful and common, so important.\n",
      "4. **目立つ (めだつ, 3)**: Common enough to be important.\n",
      "5. **駄目 (だめ, 3)**: Useful but perhaps less critical.\n",
      "6. **目次 (もくじ, 2)**: More specialized, not as important.\n",
      "7. **目撃者 (もくげきしゃ, 0)**: Least important, with a score of 0.\n",
      "\n",
      "The user's instruction says that for each kanji, at least one word should be important to cover the most important reading. However, since each word is associated with its own kanji, perhaps I need to ensure that each kanji has at least one important word attached to it. But looking at the list:\n",
      "\n",
      "- 目: has multiple words (e.g., 目的, 目立つ, etc.), so if any of those are important, that's covered.\n",
      "- 番目: associated with 番\n",
      "- 駄目: associated with 駄\n",
      "- 目次 and 目撃者 also relate to 目.\n",
      "\n",
      "But maybe the approach is different. Since each word is a separate entry, I should consider each word individually based on its own importance score and whether it's useful for learning important readings of its kanji.\n",
      "\n",
      "So:\n",
      "\n",
      "- High scores (4 and 5): These are definitely important.\n",
      "- Scores 3: Maybe include them if they're useful, but prioritize higher scores first.\n",
      "- Scores 2 and below: Probably not as crucial.\n",
      "\n",
      "Therefore:\n",
      "\n",
      "Important:\n",
      "- 目 (め, 5) - because it's the highest score and fundamental.\n",
      "- 目的 (もくてき,4) - high frequency and important reading.\n",
      "- 番目 (ばんめ,3) - useful but maybe not as critical as higher scores.\n",
      "- 目立つ (めだつ,3) - also useful.\n",
      "\n",

      "- 目次 (もくじ,2)\n",
      "- 目撃者 (もくげきしゃ,0)\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, but the user said \"Some of the words are going to be learned directly after the kanji,\" so perhaps for each kanji, we need at least one important word. Let's check:\n",
      "\n",
      "For the kanji 目: there are multiple words (目, 目的, 番目 is actually 番 + 目, but as a separate word). So if we have 目 and 目的 as important, that covers the main readings of 目.\n",
      "\n",
      "番目 is a separate kanji (番) with its own reading. If it's associated with 番, then perhaps 番目 needs to be considered under 番. But in this list, it's presented as a word on its own. So maybe treat each word separately.\n",
      "\n",
      "So the important words are those with high scores and utility. Therefore:\n",
      "\n",
      "Important: 目 (5), 目的(4), 番目(3), 目立つ(3)\n",
      "\n",
      "Not-important: 駄目(3), 目次(2), 目撃者(0)\n",
      "\n",
      "But wait, the user's instruction says \"for each kanji\" to have at least one important word. So if a kanji only has non-important words, we might need to include one. But in this case, most of the high-score words are already covering their respective kanji.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alternatively, maybe all words with score 3 or above are important, and below that are not. But the user didn't specify an exact cutoff.\n",
      "\n",
      "But considering the scores:\n",
      "\n",
      "5: top priority\n",
      "4: next\n",
      "3: useful but perhaps optional\n",
      "2 and below: least important\n",
      "\n",
      "Therefore, including all 5,4,3 as important, and 2,0 as not.\n",
      "\n",
      "So final list:\n",
      "\n",
      "Important:\n",
      "- 目 (め,5)\n",
      "- 目的 (もくてき,4)\n",
      "- 番目 (ばんめ,3)\n",
      "- 目立つ (めだつ,3)\n",
      "\n",
      "Not-important:\n",
      "- 駄目 (だめ,3) [maybe include as optional]\n",
      "Wait, but 3 is still a decent score. Maybe include all except the lowest.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alternatively, perhaps scores 5 and 4 are definitely important, and 3 could be considered based on utility.\n",
      "\n",
      "But without specific instructions, I'll go with including all above 3 as important, and below as not.\n",
      "\n",
      "Thus:\n",
      "\n",
      "Important: 目 (め,5), 目的(もくてき,4), 番目(ばんめ,3)\n",
      "\n",
      "Not-important: 目立つ(めだつ,3) [since it's a tie], 駄目(だめ,3), 目次(2), 目撃者(0)\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, but this is getting complicated. Maybe the user wants all words with scores above 3 to be important and others not.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alternatively, perhaps just include the top two or three based on score.\n",
      "\n",
      "But to follow the instruction correctly: \"Some of the words are going to be learned directly after the kanji,\" implying that for each kanji, at least one word is important. But since the words are separate, maybe it's better to prioritize by score.\n",
      "\n",
      "In conclusion, considering the highest scores first:\n",

      "Important:\n",

      "\n",
      "方 (かた, 5): Same kanji, higher score, likely important.\n",

      "一方 (いっぽう, 2): Meaning could be \"one side\" or part of something. The lower score suggests maybe not as crucial, but it's a reading for 方 and the kanji 一. However, since the user wants at least one word per kanji to be important, I might have to check if this is essential.\n",
      "\n",
      "仕方 (しかた,4): Means \"way\" or \"method,\" similar to 方法 but perhaps more common in phrases like 仕方がない (shikata ga nai). It's a high usage word, so probably important.\n",

      "But wait, each entry here represents a different kanji combination. So for the single kanji 方, we have two readings: かた and かた (with higher score). For 方法 and 方向, they're compounds using 方 but add more meaning. Similarly, 一方 uses 方 as part of another word.\n",
      "\n",
      "I think each compound is its own entry here, so when deciding which to include in Important, I should pick those that are high usage or have high scores. \n",
      "\n",
      "Looking at the scores: The highest score is 5 for one of the single readings of 方 (かた,5). Then others are mostly 4s and a 2.\n",
      "\n",
      "Since each word's importance is based on its own score, higher scores mean more important. So I should include all with score >=4 as Important and those below as Not-important.

      "\n",
      "Wait, perhaps each entry here represents a separate kanji, but actually, some are compounds. Maybe I'm overcomplicating. The user wants to sort all provided words into Important and Not-important lists based on their individual importance scores.\n",
      "\n",
      "Looking back, the user's instruction was: \"Some of the words are going to be learned directly after the kanji, and others are to be learned later.\" So it's about whether each word is important enough to learn with its kanji or should be postponed.\n",
      "\n",
      "The importance score probably helps here. Words with higher scores (4-5) are more important, while lower ones (2) might not be as crucial.\n",

      "- 仕方 (しかた,4)\n",
      "\n",
      "Not-important:\n",
      "- 一方 (いっぽう,2), since it's the only one with a lower score.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, but each entry is a word. So for example, 方 appears in multiple words. The user wants to know which of these words are important enough to learn after their kanji, and others can be learned later.\n",
      "\n",
      "Therefore, I need to decide for each word if it's important or not based on the criteria.\n",

      "Important: Words that are useful and represent important readings.\n",
      "\n",
      "Not-important: Those that aren't as crucial.\n",
      "\n",
      "Looking at the scores:\n",
      "\n",
      "- 方 (かた,4): score 4.\n",
      "- 方 (かた,5): same kanji but higher score, so maybe more important? Or perhaps this is a different reading for the same kanji. But since they're separate entries, I think both should be considered individually.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, no. Each entry in the list is a separate word with its own kanji and readings. So each line is a word to consider.\n",
      "\n",
      "So:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. 方 (かた,4): important because it's a common kanji and high score.\n",
      "2. 方 (かた,5): same kanji but higher score; this might be more important, so include both in Important.\n",
      "3. 方法 (ほうほう,4): compound word with high score, important.\n",
      "4. 方向 (ほうこう,4): another compound with high score, important.\n",
      "5. 一方 (いっぽう,2): lower score, maybe not as crucial, so Not-important.\n",
      "6. 仕方 (しかた,4): high usage and score, important.\n",
      "\n",
      "So the Important list would include all except 一方 (いっぽう,2).\n",
      "\n",
      "But I should make sure that at least one word per kanji is important for its most important reading. However, in this case, each entry is a separate word with their own readings, so perhaps it's more about individual words rather than per kanji.\n",
      "\n",
      "Therefore, Important: 方 (かた,5), 方法 (ほうほう,4), 方向 (ほうこう,4), 仕方 (しかた,4)\n",
      "Not-important: 方 (かた,4), 一方 (いっぽう,2)\n",
      "\n",
      "But wait, the first entry is 方 (かた,4) and the second is also 方 with a higher score. So perhaps both are important but one more so.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alternatively, maybe the user wants each kanji's most important reading to be learned directly. Since 方 has multiple readings, we might need to pick the highest score for it, which is 5.\n",
      "\n",
      "But since the words are separate entries, I think each word should be considered individually based on their own scores and usage.\n",
      "\n",
      "So final decision:\n",
      "\n",
      "Important: 方 (かた,5), 方法 (ほうほう,4), 方向 (ほうこう,4), 仕方 (しかた,4)\n",
      "Not-important: 方 (かた,4), 一方 (いっぽう,2)\n",
      "\n",
      "But looking at the original instruction, the user provided all words and wants them sorted. So I need to list all as either Important or Not-important.\n",
      "\n",
      "So in the response, it should be:\n",
      "\n",
      "Important: 方 (かた,5), 方法 (ほうほう,4), 方向 (ほうこう,4), 仕方 (しかた,4)\n",
      "Not-important: 方 (かた,4), 一方 (いっぽう,2)\n",
      "\n",
      "But wait, all these words except the ones with score >=4 are not important. So:\n",
      "\n",
      "Important: those with scores 5 and 4\n",
      "Not-important: the one with score 2.\n",
      "\n",
      "So that would be Important includes entries with 4 and 5, Not-important is the one with 2.\n",

      "2. 悪い (わるい, 5): This is an adjective meaning \"bad\" or \"evil.\" It's a common word used frequently in Japanese. The kanji is also 悪, and the reading here is わる. The importance score is higher at 5, indicating it's more crucial.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. 気持ち悪い (きもちわるい, 4): This phrase means \"feeling bad\" or \"nauseous.\" It uses 悪 again with the reading わる. The kanji here is 気, which is part of the word, but the main focus might be on 悪 for this phrase.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, I need to determine which words should be learned immediately after the kanji they contain.\n",
      "\n",
      "Starting with 悪人 (あくにん). Since it's associated with the kanji 悪 and has a reading あく, which is less common than わる. However, its importance score is 3. On the other hand, 悪い (わるい) is a very useful word with a high importance score of 5, and it's a direct reading for 悪. It’s essential to learn this early because it's so common.\n",
      "\n",
      "For 気持ち悪い (きもちわるい), the main kanji might be 気 since that's part of the word, but the reading is about 悪 (わる). However, this phrase is a useful expression on its own. But considering the task, I should focus on the kanji each word contains. Since it includes 悪 in its reading, maybe it's better to include it if it helps with that kanji’s important reading.\n",
      "\n",
      "But wait, the user wants to sort the words by their kanji. So for each kanji, we need to decide which words should be learned immediately after that kanji.\n",
      "\n",
      "Looking at the words:\n",
      "\n",
      "- 悪人: uses 悪 (あく)\n",
      "- 悪い: uses 悪 (わる)\n",
      "- 気持ち悪い: uses 悪 (わる)\n",
      "\n",
      "So, for the kanji 悪, the important readings are あく and わる. Now, we need to assign words that represent these readings.\n",
      "\n",
      "The word 悪人 (あくにん) represents the reading あく, which is less common but still a valid reading. However, the importance score for this word is lower (3). The word 悪い (わるい) has a higher score (5) and represents the more common and important reading of 悪 as わる.\n",
      "\n",
      "The phrase 気持ち悪い (きもちわるい) also uses the reading わる but for the kanji 悪. Since it's an important expression, maybe it should be included in the important list because it helps with understanding the common reading of 悪 as わる.\n",
      "\n",
      "But wait, the user wants to sort the words based on their kanji. So each word is associated with a particular kanji. For example:\n",
      "\n",
      "- 悪人: kanji is 悪 (あく)\n",
      "- 悪い: kanji is 悪 (わる)\n",
      "- 気持ち悪い: kanji is 気, but the reading uses 悪 (わる). Hmm, this might be a bit confusing.\n",
      "\n",
      "Perhaps I should focus on each kanji individually. Let's list out the kanji in each word:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. 悪人: 悪\n",
      "2. 悪い: 悪\n",
      "3. 気持ち悪い: 気 and 悪 (but primarily about 感受, so maybe the main kanji is 気)\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, this might complicate things. Maybe I should consider each word's kanji separately.\n",
      "\n",
      "Looking at 悪人 (あくにん), the kanji is 悪, and its reading is あく. The importance score is 3.\n",
      "\n",
      "For 悪い (わるい), the kanji is 悪 with reading わる, score 5.\n",
      "\n",
      "For 気持ち悪い (きもちわるい), the main kanji might be 気 (as it's part of \"気持ち\"), but the 悪 is used in the reading. However, since the task is to sort the words based on their kanji, I think each word should be associated with its primary kanji.\n",
      "\n",
      "But perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. The user wants the flashcards sorted into important and not-important lists. So for each kanji, assign the words that are most useful first.\n",
      "\n",
      "Given that, 悪い (わるい) is highly important with a score of 5, so it should definitely be in the important list as it represents the common reading of 悪.\n",
      "\n",
      "The word 悪人 (あくにん) has a lower importance score but still shows another reading of 悪. Since it's at least somewhat important (3), maybe it's better to include it in the important list to cover both readings of 悪.\n",
      "\n",
      "As for 気持ち悪い, since it uses 悪 as well, and it's an important phrase with a score of 4, perhaps it should also be included in the important list because it reinforces the reading わる for 悪.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, but the user mentioned that some words are learned directly after the kanji. So if we have multiple readings for a single kanji, we might want to include at least one word that represents the most common or important reading.\n",
      "\n",
      "In this case, since both あく and わる are readings of 悪, but わる is more common and higher in importance (score 5), it's essential to have 悪い as an important word. For 悪人, even though its score is lower, it represents a different reading, so including it ensures that both readings of 悪 are covered.\n",
      "\n",
      "Therefore, all three words might be considered important because they either represent crucial readings or are highly useful. However, since the user wants to split them into important and not-important, perhaps only the most essential ones go first.\n",
      "\n",
      "But considering the importance scores:\n",
      "\n",
      "- 悪い: 5 (highly important)\n",
      "- 気持ち悪い: 4 (also important)\n",
      "- 悪人: 3 (moderately important)\n",
      "\n",
      "Since all have scores above a certain threshold, maybe they're all important. But if I had to choose based on the kanji's importance, perhaps only one word per kanji is needed, but there are multiple readings.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alternatively, since each word is associated with a different kanji:\n",
      "\n",
      "- 悪人: 悪 (あく)\n",
      "- 悪い: 悁 (わる) – Wait, no. Both words have the same kanji 悧, just different readings.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ah, so it's the same kanji but different readings and compounds. So, for the kanji 悡, we need to decide which words are important.\n",
      "\n",
      "Since both readings あく and わる are valid, including both in the important list makes sense because they cover different aspects of the kanji.\n",
      "\n",
      "Therefore, all three words might be considered important as each contributes to understanding either the kanji or its readings. But perhaps 悪人 is less commonly used than the others, so it could go into not-important.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alternatively, if we consider that 気持ち悪い also uses 悁 in its reading but isn't directly a compound of 悁, maybe it's better to separate them.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me think again.\n",
      "\n",
      "Each word has its own kanji(s):\n",
      "\n",
      "1. 悪人: 悩 (as the main kanji)\n",
      "2. 悪い: 悓\n",
      "3. 気持ち悪い: 感受 + 悁\n",
      "\n",
      "But perhaps for flashcards, each word is associated with its primary kanji. So:\n",
      "\n",
      "- 悪人: kanji 悓\n",
      "- 悪い: kanji 悓\n",
      "- 気持ち悪い: kanji 感受 (気) and the reading uses 悁.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, this complicates it because a single word can have multiple kanji. Maybe I should treat each word separately regardless of the kanji they contain.\n",
      "\n",
      "Given that, all three words are important as per their scores:\n",
      "\n",
      "- 5, 4, 3.\n",
      "\n",
      "But since the user wants to split them into two lists, perhaps only the highest ones go into important, and the rest into not-important. Alternatively, maybe all with scores above a certain threshold (like 3) are important.\n",
      "\n",
      "In this case, I think it's better to include all as they have relatively high importance scores. But if we have to choose based on the kanji's criticalness, perhaps only 悪い and 気持ち悪い are essential because they represent more common usage of 悁, while 悪人 is less common.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alternatively, maybe I should follow the user’s initial thought process without overcomplicating it. They mentioned assigning words to important or not based on their perceived importance. So:\n",
      "\n",
      "- Important: 悪い (5), 気持ち悪い (4)\n",
      "- Not-important: 悪人 (3)\n",
      "\n",
      "But I'm not sure if 3 is low enough. Alternatively, all three are important.\n",
      "\n",
      "In conclusion, given the scores and the fact that both readings of 悁 are covered by different words, it's safer to include all in the important list.\n",
      "</think>\n",
      "\n",

The goal is to decide which words should be learned immediately after the kanji (important) and which can wait (not-important).\n",
      "\n",
      "First, let me look at each word and its details.\n",
      "\n",
      "1. 上手 (じょうず, 4): This means \"skillful\" or \"expert.\" It's a common word with a high importance score of 4. Definitely important to learn early.\n",
      "2. 上級 (じょうきゅう, 3): Means \"upper level\" or \"advanced.\" Importance is 3, which is still quite significant. Should be important.\n",
      "3. 上＊る (のぼる, 3): This is the verb \"noboru,\" meaning \"to go up\" or \"climb.\" It's a basic verb with an importance score of 3. Important to include.\n",
      "4. 上＊げる (あげる, 5): Another verb, \"agaru,\" which means \"to be raised\" or \"go up.\" High importance score of 5. Very important.\n",
      "5. 上＊がる (あがる, 5): The verb \"ageru,\" meaning \"to raise\" or \"lift.\" Importance is 5, so definitely important.\n",
      "6. 上 (うえ, 5): This is a basic particle meaning \"on top\" or \"above.\" High importance score of 5. Essential to learn early.\n",
      "7. 上 (じょう, 2): Another reading for the same kanji, meaning \"upper\" or \"senior.\" Importance is 2, which is moderate. Since it's not as high as others, maybe not crucial immediately.\n",
      "8. 以上 (いじょう, 4): Means \"more than\" or \"over.\" Importance score of 4, so important.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, the user wants to sort these words into two lists: Important and Not-important. The key is that for each kanji, at least one word should be important to cover the most essential reading.\n",
      "\n",
      "Looking at 上 (うえ), it's a particle with high importance, so including 上＊る or 上＊げる would cover that reading. But since 上＊る has a high score and is a common verb, maybe not all need to be in Important.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, no—each word is separate. Let me clarify:\n",
      "\n",
      "- The kanji 上 can have readings うえ, じょう, etc. So each of these words uses the kanji 上 but with different readings and usages.\n",
      "\n",
      "So for sorting, each word's importance should be considered individually, not tied to the same kanji unless it's the same word.\n",
      "\n",
      "But in this case, all words are separate: 上手, 上級, 上＊る, etc. Each is a unique word using the 上 kanji but with different readings and meanings.\n",
      "\n",
      "The user wants to decide which of these should be learned immediately after the kanji based on their importance and whether they represent important readings.\n",
      "\n",
      "Important ones should have high utility or represent key readings for that kanji.\n",
      "\n",
      "Looking again:\n",
      "\n",
      "- 上手 (じょうず,4): Important because it's a common adjective.\n",
      "- 上級 (じょうきゅう,3): Also important as an upper level noun.\n",
      "- 上＊る (のぼる,3): Important verb.\n",
      "- 上＊げる and 上＊がる both have high scores (5) but are similar verbs. Maybe include the more common one or both if possible.\n",
      "- 上 (うえ,5): Very basic particle—definitely important.\n",
      "- 上 (じょう,2): Lower importance, so maybe not immediate.\n",
      "- 以上 (いじょう,4): Important because it's a useful adverb.\n",
      "\n",
      "So I think all except perhaps 上 (じょう,2) should be considered important. But since the user allows some to be not-important if they're less crucial, and at least one per kanji needs to be important, maybe 上 (じょう,2) can go into Not-important because it's lower priority compared to others.\n",

      "Looking at 電卓 (でんたく), which means calculator and has a score of 2. The kanji here is 電 (でん). I know that 電 can also be read as でん in other words like 電話 (でんわ, denwa) for telephone. But since the given word is 電卓 with the reading でんたく, it's a common enough word to be considered important because calculators are everyday items and the reading でん is widely used.\n",
      "\n",
      "Next, 食卓 (しょくたく), which means dining table and has a score of 1. The kanji here is 食 (しょく). I know that 食 can also mean to eat, as in 食事 (しょくじ, shokuji) for meal. However, the reading しょく is important because it's a common on'yomi (sound symbol) used in many compound words related to eating or food. Even though the score is lower at 1, the kanji 食 is fundamental, and knowing しょく helps with understanding other words.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, considering the importance scores: 2 for 電卓 and 1 for 食卓. The user mentioned that even if a word isn't as important, it should still be learned first if it teaches an essential reading of the kanji. Both words seem to contribute to understanding their respective kanji's readings.\n",

      "2. 幸運 (こううん, 3)\n",
      "3. 不幸 (ふこう, 2)\n",
      "4. 幸*せ (しあわせ, 4)\n",
      "\n",
      "The goal is to create flashcards where some words are learned directly after the kanji, and others later. The key is that words learned directly should be useful and represent important readings.\n",
      "\n",
      "First, I need to look at each word and determine if it's essential for learning the primary reading of its kanji. Since all words contain a certain kanji, I have to assess which ones are most indicative of those kanji's meanings or readings.\n",
      "\n",
      "Let me break down each word:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. 幸*い (さいわい, 2)\n",
      "   - The kanji here is '幸' with a star, possibly indicating an alternative reading or form.\n",
      "   - The reading is 'さいわい', which means happiness or good luck. The importance score is 2.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. 幸運 (こううん, 3)\n",
      "   - Another word using '幸', meaning good fortune. Reading 'こううん' with a higher importance score of 3.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. 不幸 (ふこう, 2)\n",
      "   - This uses the kanji '不幸', which means misfortune or unhappiness. Importance score is 2.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. 幸*せ (しあわせ, 4)\n",
      "   - Again, using '幸' with a star, reading 'しあわせ' meaning happy or lucky. Score of 4, which is the highest among them.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, considering each kanji and their primary readings:\n",
      "\n",
      "- For '幸', the most common and important readings are 'さいわい' (happiness) and 'しあわせ' (happy). These are core to understanding the kanji's meaning.\n",
      "  \n",
      "- 幸運 (こううん) is another important reading but might be a bit more specific, focusing on good fortune rather than general happiness.\n",
      "\n",
      "- 不幸 (ふこう) is the opposite of 幸, so it's also important but perhaps less central depending on context.\n",
      "\n",
      "Looking at importance scores:\n",
      "\n",
      "- しあわせ has the highest score (4), making it crucial. It likely represents one of the most common and essential readings for '幸'.\n",
      "\n",
      "- さいわい comes next with a score of 2, still significant as it's another core reading.\n",
      "\n",
      "- 幸運 is also important at 3, but maybe not as central as the first two.\n",
      "\n",
      "- 不幸 has a lower score (2), which might mean it's less prioritized for direct learning after the kanji.\n",
      "\n",
      "Given that, I should prioritize words that teach the main readings of the kanji. Both 'さいわい' and 'しあわせ' are fundamental, so they should be in the important list. 幸運 could be considered as well since it's a significant reading, but perhaps it's more specialized. However, given its score is higher than the others except しあわせ, I might include it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alternatively, since '幸' is a single kanji, and 幸*い and 幸*せ both use that same kanji with different readings and forms (with * indicating perhaps a different component or iteration?), maybe each represents an important aspect. \n",
      "\n",
      "But wait, the user said to return the words as they were given, including any stars. So for '幸*い' and '幸*せ', the kanji is part of a compound that includes a star.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, I think the main point is to focus on the primary readings. Since 'しあわせ' has the highest score, it's essential. 'さいわい' is also crucial as another important reading. 幸運 might be more of a derivative or less common usage, so perhaps it's better to include it in not-important if we need to prioritize.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, but looking back, the user wants to sort all words into important and not-important. So for each word, decide whether it's important enough to learn directly after the kanji.\n",
      "\n",
      "The highest scores are 4 (しあわせ), then 3 (幸運), then 2s. Since at least one word should always be important to learn the most important reading, but we can have more if they're useful.\n",
      "\n",
      "Therefore:\n",
      "\n",
      "Important: 幸*い (さいわい, 2) might not be as critical as しあわせ, which is a higher score and likely a more common reading. Wait, no, both are readings of '幸', so maybe both should be important.\n",
      "\n",
      "But considering that しあわせ has the highest score and is a fundamental word for happiness, perhaps it's essential to include it in the important list. Similarly, 幸運 with a score of 3 might also be considered important as it represents another key aspect (fortune).\n",
      "\n",
      "On the other hand, 不幸 has a lower score and might be more specialized.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, but according to the instructions, the words that are learned directly after the kanji should only be those that are useful and represent important readings. So perhaps all four are somewhat important, but we need to categorize them into two lists.\n",
      "\n",
      "But the user wants to split them into Important and Not-important based on whether they're useful for learning the most important reading of the word.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, no, it's about whether the words themselves are learned directly after the kanji. So if a word is too obscure or not as important, it should be learned later.\n",
      "\n",
      "Given that, perhaps 幸*せ (4) and 幸運 (3) are more useful, while 幸*い (2) and 不幸 (2) might be less so.\n",
      "\n",
      "But I'm a bit confused. Let me try to think again:\n",
      "\n",
      "Each kanji has certain readings. The words provided include these readings.\n",
      "\n",
      "The task is to decide which words should be learned immediately after the kanji because they're useful and represent important readings, and which should be learned later.\n",
      "\n",
      "Given that, I would prioritize the words with higher importance scores as more important to learn directly.\n",
      "\n",
      "So:\n",
      "\n",
      "Important: 幸*せ (4), 幸運 (3)\n",
      "Not-important: 幸*い (2), 不幸 (2)\n",
      "\n",
      "But wait, '幸*い' has a reading of さいわい, which is another important reading. Maybe it's better to include both しあわせ and さいわい as important since they're both core readings.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alternatively, maybe all four words are important but categorized based on their scores.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, the user said \"All words may be classified as important. But for less important kanji it is acceptable to have less important words. Although at least one word should always be important to learn the most important reading of the word.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "So perhaps each kanji's primary reading is covered by at least one important word.\n",
      "\n",
      "Looking at '幸' and '不幸', which are separate kanjis? Wait, no, all words contain a certain kanji, but they might share the same kanji or not. Let me check:\n",
      "\n",
      "- 幸*い: uses '幸'\n",
      "- 幸運: uses '幸'\n",
      "- 不幸: uses '不幸'\n",
      "- 幸*せ: uses '幸'\n",
      "\n",
      "So '幸' and '不幸' are two separate kanjis.\n",
      "\n",
      "Therefore, for each kanji, we need to ensure that at least one word is considered important to cover its primary reading.\n",
      "\n",
      "For the kanji '幸':\n",
      "\n",
      "The main readings are さいわい (幸*い) and しあわせ (幸*せ). Both are fundamental. So both should be in Important.\n",
      "\n",
      "For the kanji '不幸' (which is a compound of '不' + '幸'):\n",
      "\n",
      "The reading is ふこう, meaning misfortune. Since this is a separate kanji, perhaps we need to include it as important if it's used commonly, but given its score is lower, maybe it goes into Not-important.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, no, the words are: \n",
      "\n",
      "- 幸*い (kanji '幸')\n",
      "- 幸運 (kanji '幸' and '運')\n",
      "- 不幸 (kanji '不幸')\n",
      "- 幸*せ (kanji '幸')\n",
      "\n",
      "So perhaps each word is associated with a specific kanji or combination.\n",
      "\n",
      "But the instruction isn't entirely clear. I think it's safer to categorize all four words, regardless of kanji, based on their importance.\n",
      "\n",
      "Given that:\n",
      "\n",
      "- 幸*せ has the highest score (4)\n",
      "- 幸運 next (3)\n",
      "- The others are 2\n",
      "\n",
      "So perhaps:\n",
      "\n",
      "Important: 幸*せ (4), 幸運 (3)\n",
      "Not-important: 幸*い (2), 不幸 (2)\n",
      "\n",
      "Alternatively, if all four are important but split based on priority.\n",
      "\n",
      "But I think the user expects to separate them into two lists. So probably:\n",
      "\n",
      "Important: 幸*せ (4), 幸運 (3)\n",
      "Not-important: 幸*い (2), 不幸 (2)\n",
      "\n",
      "Thus, the final answer would be:\n",
      "\n",
      "Important: 幸*せ and 幸運\n",
      "Not-important: 幸*い and 不幸\n",
      "\n",
      "But I'm not entirely sure. Another approach is that since each word has its own kanji context, maybe all should be considered important because they cover different aspects of '幸'. But the scores indicate priority.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alternatively, perhaps only the highest score per kanji is considered important. Since 幸*せ and 幸運 are both under '幸', but with different kanji combinations, it's possible that both could be important.\n",
      "\n",
      "But to avoid overcomplicating, I'll go with the initial thought.\n",

      "1. 増加 (ぞうか, 1)\n",

      "2. いい加減 (いいかげん, 2)\n",
      "   - This means about right or moderate. It's a common expression, so it seems useful.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. 加*える (くわえる, 3)\n",
      "   - The asterisk indicates a kanji that is part of the word but isn't the main focus here. The reading \"kwaeru\" meaning to add is quite basic and essential.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. 参加 (さんか, 3)\n",

The user provided a specific example with two words: 妥協 (だきょう, 3) and another one that's cut off in the initial prompt, but from the response they gave, I can see it's 妥協 as well.\n",

      "First, I need to understand the criteria. The user wants words learned directly after kanji if they're useful or represent important readings. If not, they should be learned later.

      "\n",
      "Wait, in this case, the user only provided one word: 妥協 (だきょう, 3). So, I need to determine whether this word is important enough to include it or not. The score is 3, which isn't very high but also not low. Maybe it's on the lower end of medium importance.\n",
      "\n",
      "I should consider if 妥協 is a commonly used word. Takuai means compromise, and while it's useful in certain contexts like business or formal situations, it might not be as frequently used in everyday conversation. Therefore, it could make sense to categorize it as not important for initial learning, especially if the kanji itself isn't crucial.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, since there's only one word here, I need to ensure that at least this one is included to cover its reading. But wait, the user's response didn't include any words in the Important list and placed 妥協 in Not-important. Is that acceptable? The guidelines say at least one word should be important for the most important reading, but if there's only one word, maybe it should go into Important regardless.\n",
      "\n",
      "Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. The user's example response has no words in Important and all in Not-important, so maybe their criteria is that even a score of 3 is low enough to be considered not important. Therefore, the answer would be:\n",

      "The user provided a word: 努*める (つとめる, 3). They want to create flashcards for both kanji and words, but some words will be learned immediately after the kanji if they're useful or represent important readings. If not, they should be learned later.\n",
      "\n",
      "First, I need to understand what makes a word \"important.\" The user mentioned that the importance score is from 0 to 5, but it's optional. They also said that at least one important word should cover the most important reading of the kanji. So, even if a word isn't super useful on its own, if it teaches a key reading, it becomes important.\n",
      "\n",
      "Looking at the given word: 努*める. The kanji here is 努, which I know means \"effort\" or \"strive.\" The reading is つとめる, and the importance score is 3. \n",
      "\n",
      "I should think about whether this word is commonly used. 努力する (つうりょくする) is a common way to say \"to make an effort,\" so 努*める might be part of that. But wait, 努める isn't as common as 労う or はげみる for striving. It might be less frequently used.\n",
      "\n",
      "Is the reading つとめる important? The kanji 努 primarily has two readings: つう (as in 労う) and つとめる. If this is the main reading, then it's crucial to include it as an important word because it teaches a key reading of the kanji that might not be covered elsewhere.\n",
      "\n",
      "Given the score is 3, which isn't too low but not high either, but since it covers an important reading, I think it should go into the important category. It helps in learning the less common but essential reading of 努.\n",

      "Alright, let me try to figure out how to sort these Japanese words into important and not-important categories based on their readings and importance scores.\n",
      "\n",
      "First, I need to understand the task. The user wants to create flashcards for kanji and words, where some are learned immediately after the kanji if they're useful and represent important readings. Others will be learned later. So, my job is to categorize each word as either important or not-important based on their utility and whether they cover key readings of the kanji.\n",
      "\n",
      "The list provided includes seven words with their readings and importance scores:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. 男尊女卑 (だんそんじょひ, 2)\n",
      "2. 男性 (だんせい, 3)\n",
      "3. 男の子 (おとこのこ, 5)\n",
      "4. 男の人 (おとこのひと, 5)\n",
      "5. 長男 (ちょうなん, 1)\n",
      "6. 男 (おとこ, 5)\n",
      "\n",
      "I need to analyze each word's relevance and importance.\n",
      "\n",
      "Starting with the kanji \"男\" which means \"boy\" or \"man.\" The most important reading for \"男\" is \"おとこ,\" so I should prioritize words that use this reading. Looking at the list:\n",
      "\n",
      "- 男 (おとこ, 5) is a direct reading of the kanji and has the highest importance score, so it's definitely important.\n",
      "- 男性 (だんせい, 3): The reading \"だんせい\" corresponds to \"dansei,\" meaning man (adult). This is also a common and important usage, but perhaps more for the word than just the kanji itself.\n",
      "- 男の子 (おとこのこ, 5) uses \"おとこ\" as part of the compound, so it's relevant and has a high score.\n",
      "- 男の人 (おとこのひと, 5): Similar to above, uses \"おとこ\" and is also important.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, looking at the other words:\n",
      "\n",
      "- 長男 (ちょうなん, 1): The reading here is \"chounan,\" meaning oldest son. While it's a valid word, its importance score is low (1), so maybe not as crucial to learn immediately.\n",
      "- 男尊女卑 (だんそんじょひ, 2): This term refers to male superiority and female inferiority, which is a concept but perhaps less commonly used in daily language. Its score is also lower.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, considering that the highest priority should be given to words that directly teach the primary reading of the kanji \"男,\" which is \"おとこ.\" The words 男、男の子、男の人 all use this reading and have high importance scores (5). These should be in the important list as they help solidify the basic understanding.\n",
      "\n",
      "The word 男性 uses a different reading, \"だんせい,\" which is also important but perhaps can come later since it's more of an advanced usage. However, its score is 3, so I'm a bit torn. Maybe including it as important because it's another key way to use the kanji and represents a significant concept.\n",
      "\n",
      "On the other hand, 長男 has a low score (1), so it should be in not-important. Similarly, 男尊女卑 with a score of 2 might also go into not-important unless there's a specific reason to include it early, but given its lower score and possibly less common usage, it's safer to put it in the not-important list.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, but the user mentioned that at least one word should always be important to learn the most important reading. Since 男 is already covering \"おとこ,\" maybe other words can still be considered. However, I think the primary focus should be on words that directly teach the kanji's readings and are highly useful.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, in conclusion:\n",
      "\n",
      "Important: 男性、男の子、男の人 (all use either \"だんせい\" or \"おとこ,\" with high scores)\n",
      "Not-important: 男尊女卑、長男 (lower scores and perhaps less common)\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, no. The user said that the words learned directly after the kanji should only be those that are useful and represent important readings. So maybe focusing on which words teach the primary readings.\n",
      "\n",
      "Since \"男\" is read as \"おとこ,\" the words 男、男の子、男の人 all include this reading, so they're essential to learn first. The word 男性 uses a different reading (だんせい), but it's another important way to use the kanji, so maybe it should also be in the important list.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alternatively, perhaps only including one word per kanji is needed, but since the user provided multiple words with the same kanji, I need to consider each individually.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, looking back at the given words:\n",
      "\n",
      "- 男尊女卑: uses two kanji (男 and 女), so maybe it's a separate entry.\n",
      "- 男性: 男\n",
      "- 男の子: 男\n",
      "- 男の人: 男\n",
      "- 長男: 長 and 男. Wait, \"長男\" is chounan, which uses the kanji 長 (long) and 男 (boy). So that's a different kanji combination.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. The user said all words contain a certain kanji. Looking at each word:\n",
      "\n",
      "- 男尊女卑: contains 男、尊、女、卑\n",
      "- 男性: 男\n",
      "- 男の子: 男\n",
      "- 男の人: 男\n",
      "- 長男: 長 and 男\n",
      "- 男: 男\n",
      "\n",
      "So, each word is associated with the kanji provided. Therefore, I need to group them by their main kanji.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, perhaps this complicates things more. Maybe the user intended that each word is tied to a specific kanji, but in reality, some words have multiple kanji. Hmm, this might require clarification, but since the instruction was to sort all given words into important and not-important based on their utility and whether they represent important readings for the kanji.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, focusing on each word's individual importance:\n",
      "\n",
      "- 男 (おとこ,5): High score, essential.\n",
      "- 男性 (だんせい,3): Important but perhaps less so than \"おとこ.\"\n",
      "- 男の子 (おとこのこ,5): Important as it uses the primary reading.\n",
      "- 男の人 (おとこのひと,5): Same here.\n",
      "- 長男 (ちょうなん,1): Low score, maybe not important to learn early.\n",
      "- 男尊女卑 (だんそんじょひ,2): Lower score and perhaps less common.\n",
      "\n",
      "Given that, I think the words with high scores should be in the important list, especially those using \"おとこ.\" So:\n",
      "\n",
      "Important: 男性、男の子、男の人\n",
      "Not-important: 長男、男尊女卑\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, but what about 男 itself? It's a word on its own and has a score of 5. Should it be included in the important list?\n",
      "\n",
      "Yes, definitely. Including 男 as an important word makes sense because it directly teaches the kanji and is highly useful.\n",
      "\n",
      "So revising:\n",
      "\n",
      "Important: 男性、男の子、男の人、男\n",
      "Not-important: 長男、男尊女卑\n",
      "\n",
      "But let's double-check the scores. The user said that the importance score ranges from 0-5, so higher numbers are more important.\n",
      "\n",
      "Looking at each word:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. 男尊女卑 (2) - Not very high.\n",
      "2. 男性 (3) - Moderate.\n",
      "3. 男の子 (5) - High.\n",
      "4. 男の人 (5) - High.\n",
      "5. 長男 (1) - Low.\n",
      "6. 男 (5) - Highest.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, including all words with a score of 5 and above as important. Therefore:\n",
      "\n",
      "Important: 男性、男の子、男の人、男\n",
      "Not-important: 長男、男尊女卑\n",
      "\n",
      "But wait, the user said that when learning kanji, only certain words are chosen based on utility. So even if \"男性\" has a score of 3, it might still be considered important because it's a common word.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alternatively, perhaps all the high-scored words (4 and above) go into important, but since I don't have specific cutoffs, I'll rely on the scores given.\n",
      "\n",
      "Therefore:\n",
      "\n",
      "Important: 男性、男の子、男の人、男\n",
      "Not-important: 長男、男尊女卑\n",
      "\n",
      "But let me think again. The user's instruction was to sort all the provided words into important and not-important based on whether they are useful and represent important readings for their kanji.\n",
      "\n",
      "Given that, I should consider each word's role in teaching the kanji:\n",
      "\n",
      "- 男 (おとこ) is essential for the kanji 男.\n",
      "- 男性 also uses 男 but with a different reading (だんせい). So it's another important way to use the same kanji.\n",
      "- 男の子 and 男の人 both use 男 with おとこ, so they're good for practice but perhaps not as crucial as 男 itself.\n",
      "\n",
      "Therefore, maybe:\n",
      "\n",
      "Important: 男、男性\n",
      "Not-important: 男の子、男の人、長男、男尊女卑\n",
      "\n",
      "But that might be too strict. Alternatively, considering utility in vocabulary acquisition, 男 is basic, 男性 is common, while the others are perhaps less so.\n",
      "\n",
      "So finalizing:\n",
      "\n",
      "Important: 男性、男、男の子、男の人\n",
      "Not-important: 長男、男尊女卑\n",
      "\n",
      "But given that all four have high scores (3 and above), except for the last two, which have lower scores. So maybe all with score ≥3 go into important.\n",
      "\n",
      "Thus:\n",
      "\n",
      "Important: 男性、男の子、男の人、男\n",
      "Not-important: 長男、男尊女卑\n",
      "\n",

      "First, let me look at each word:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. 奇妙 (きみょう, 2)\n",

      "I notice that two of these words share the same kanji: \"妙.\" The first one is read as \"きみょう\" with a score of 2, and the fourth is also \"妙\" but read differently as \"びみょう\"? Wait, no, actually looking again, 奇妙 is \"きみょう,\" 微妙 is \"びみょう,\" and both 妙 entries are different readings. Wait, that might not be right because the third word is 妙 with reading みょう (1), and the fourth is also 妙 but with a lower score of 0.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, no, looking again: The first three words have different kanji. Oh, wait no, actually, let me clarify:\n",
      "\n",
      "- 奇妙 has the kanji 奇妙, reading きみょう, score 2.\n",
      "- 微妙 is another word with kanji 微妙, reading びみょう, score 3.\n",
      "- Then there are two entries for 妙: one is 妙 (みょう) with a score of 1, and another 妙 (みょう) with a score of 0. Hmm, that seems redundant.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, perhaps the user made a typo or mistake in listing. Because both third and fourth words are 妙 with readings みょう but different scores. That might be an error because usually, each entry should have unique information.\n",
      "\n",
      "But regardless, I need to process them as given.\n",
      "\n",
      "The main goal is to decide which words should be learned directly after the kanji (Important) and which should be learned later (Not-important). The criteria are that the word must be useful and represent an important reading. For less important kanji, it's okay to have less important words, but at least one word should always be important to learn the most important reading.\n",
      "\n",
      "So let's analyze each word:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. 奇妙 (きみょう, 2): This means \"strange\" or \"peculiar.\" The score is 2, which is moderate. It's a useful word in general conversation.\n",
      "2. 微妙 (びみょう, 3): Means \"subtle,\" \"delicate,\" or \"nuanced.\" Score of 3 suggests it's more important than 奇妙. This is also a commonly used word.\n",
      "3. 妙 (みょう, 1): As a single kanji, 妙 can mean \"clever\" or \"ingenious.\" The score here is 1, which is lower.\n",
      "4. 妙 (みょう, 0): Same kanji as above but with a lower score of 0.\n",
      "\n",
      "The user also mentioned that some words are learned directly after the kanji if they're useful and represent important readings. So for each kanji, we should pick at least one word that is most essential to learn its primary reading.\n",
      "\n",
      "Looking at 奇妙 and 微妙: These are two different kanji compounds with their own readings. Each of these likely forms their own set, so the words under them need to be considered separately.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, focusing on the 妙 kanji:\n",
      "\n",
      "- The third entry is 妙 (みょう, 1). Since it's a single kanji, knowing this reading would help in understanding compounds like 奇妙 and 微妙. However, its score is low (1), but it's still important because without knowing the basic meaning of 妙, one might struggle with compound words.\n",
      "\n",
      "The fourth entry is 妙 (みょう, 0). This seems redundant or perhaps a typo. Since both entries are the same kanji and reading, maybe only one should be considered. But given that they're separate, I'll treat them as two entries but likely need to group them together.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, for the important list, we need to include words that are useful and represent important readings.\n",
      "\n",
      "- 奇妙 (2) is a solid word with a moderate score.\n",
      "- 微妙 (3) has a higher score, indicating it's more important than 奇妙.\n",
      "- The two 妙 entries have lower scores but still serve as the base reading for other words.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, since the user wants to sort all provided words into Important and Not-important lists based on their usefulness and importance of readings.\n",
      "\n",
      "Given that, I would probably include 微妙 (3) in Important because it has a higher score and is more nuanced. 奇妙 (2) could go either way but might be included as important due to its moderate score. The single 妙 kanji with a score of 1 should definitely be learned early, while the one with 0 could be saved for later.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, but the user's instruction says that all words may be classified as important, but for less important kanji, it's acceptable to have less important words. At least one word per kanji should be important.\n",
      "\n",
      "So perhaps:\n",
      "\n",
      "- For 奇妙: It's a compound and has a score of 2; it can be considered important.\n",
      "- For 微妙: Score of 3, definitely important.\n",
      "- For 妙: Since it's the base kanji, at least one entry should be important. The third word (妙, 1) is better than the fourth (0). So include 3rd in Important and 4th in Not-important.\n",

      "So the Important list would have:\n",

      "- 奇妙 (2)\n",
      "- 微妙 (3)\n",

      "\n",
      "First, I need to understand the kanji involved in each word. Let's break them down:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. 京都 is made up of two kanji: 京 (kyō) and 都 (to). The reading for this combination is きょうと.\n",
      "2. 東京都 consists of three kanji: 東 (higashi), 京 (kyō), and 都 (to). Its reading is とうきょうと.\n",
      "3. 東京 is two kanji as well: 東 (higashi) and 京 (kyō), with the reading とうきょう.\n",
      "\n",
      "The importance scores are 3, 4, and 4 respectively. The user mentioned that words learned directly after a kanji should be useful and represent important readings. If a word isn't useful or doesn't show an important reading, it should be learned later.\n",
      "\n",
      "Looking at each word:\n",
      "\n",
      "- 京都: This is the capital city of Japan (Kyoto), so it's quite commonly used. The importance score is 3, which might not be as high as others but still significant.\n",
      "- 東京都: This refers to Tokyo Metropolis, which is one of the most important cities globally. The importance score here is 4, indicating higher relevance.\n",
      "- 東京: This is just \"Tokyo\" and also has a high usage in daily language. Its score is 4.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, I need to determine which kanji each word teaches. For example:\n",
      "\n",
      "- If we learn 京 from 京都 or 東京, the reading would be kyō.\n",
      "- 都 can be learned from both 京都 and 東京都, with readings to and tsu (but in 京都 it's to).\n",
      "- 東 is only present in 東京都 and 東京.\n",
      "\n",
      "Considering that each kanji should have at least one important word to learn the most important reading, I think:\n",
      "\n",
      "- The kanji 京 appears in both 京都 and 東京. Since 東京 has a higher usage (as Tokyo is more commonly referenced than Kyoto), it might be better to associate 京 with 東京 for its primary reading.\n",
      "- 都 appears in 京都 and 東京都. Again, 東京都 being a major city, maybe that's the more important word to pair with 都.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, since each kanji should have at least one important word, perhaps:\n",
      "\n",
      "- For 京: Both 京都 and 東京 are good, but 東京 is more frequently used, so it's essential.\n",
      "- For 都: 京都 might be sufficient because it's a well-known city, but 東京都 also uses the same kanji. Given that both words use 都, maybe either can be chosen, but since 東京都 has a higher score (4 vs. 3), perhaps that's better.\n",
      "- For 東: Only appears in 東京都 and 東京. Both are high importance.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, but each word is made up of multiple kanji. So for example, if I choose 東京都 as the important word, it covers two kanji: 東 and 京 and 都. But maybe that's too many to cover in one word.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alternatively, selecting both 東京 and 京都 might spread out the learning but ensure each kanji is covered with an important word.\n",
      "\n",
      "But looking at their importance scores:\n",
      "\n",
      "- 京都 (3) vs. 東京 (4) vs. 東京都 (4). So maybe 東京 is more important because it's a higher score, even though both have 4.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, no, the user provided three words with those scores. The task is to assign each word as important or not, based on their usefulness and whether they represent an important reading for the kanji.\n",
      "\n",
      "So perhaps:\n",
      "\n",
      "- 東京 (4) is important because it's a major city and commonly used.\n",
      "- 京都 (3) might still be considered important since Kyoto is significant but maybe less so than Tokyo.\n",
      "- 東京都 (4), being another form of Tokyo, could be redundant if we already have 東京.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alternatively, perhaps both 東京 and 東京都 are important because they're both major city names and use different readings for the kanji. But I think that might complicate things.\n",
      "\n",
      "I need to decide which words should be learned directly after their kanji. For example:\n",
      "\n",
      "- If a word is essential for learning an important reading of its kanji, it's important; otherwise, it goes to not-important.\n",

      "1. 京 appears in 京都 (kyō) and 東京 (kyō). Both are important readings.\n",
      "2. 都 appears in 京都 (to) and 東京都 (tsu or to). The reading 'tsu' is another important aspect, but maybe the 'to' in 京都 is more common.\n",
      "3. 東 appears only in 東京都 (higashi) and 東京 (higashi), both of which are important.\n",
      "\n",

      "Wait no, the user said \"All words contain a certain kanji.\" So each word corresponds to one kanji.

      "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how to sort these Japanese words into important and not-important categories based on their readings and importance scores. The user provided a specific format to follow, so I need to make sure I stick to that.\n",
      "\n",
      "First, let's look at the word given: 寂＊しい (さびしい, 3). The kanji here is 寂, which means \"lonely\" or \"quiet.\" The reading is さびしい, and it has an importance score of 3. \n",
      "\n",
      "Now, the task is to decide if this word should be in the important list or not. Since the score is 3 out of 5, it's moderately important. I know that 寂 isn't a super common kanji, but さびしい is a useful word meaning \"lonely\" or \"quiet,\" which are pretty common adjectives in Japanese. So, even if the kanji isn't used extremely often, the word itself is quite useful.\n",
      "\n",
      "The instructions say that words learned directly after the kanji should only be those that are useful and represent important readings. 寂＊しい definitely fits because it's a fundamental adjective that learners would benefit from knowing early on. It also teaches one of the key readings for the kanji 寂, which might not have many other common readings.\n",
      "\n",
      "Even though 3 is mid-level importance, considering the practicality of the word and its relevance to learning the kanji, it makes sense to include it in the important list. There's no indication that this word is less useful or that another reading for 寂 is more critical, so it should be prioritized.\n",

      "First, I need to understand the task. The goal is to create flashcards where some words are learned right after the kanji, and others later. The key here is that for each kanji, at least one word should be important to cover the most crucial reading.\n",
      "\n",
      "Looking at the given words:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. 線 (せん, 4)\n",
      "2. 線 (せん, 2)\n",
      "3. 新幹線 (しんかんせん, 3)\n",

      "Hmm, I notice that both 線 readings are from the same kanji but with different importance scores. The first one has a score of 4, which is quite high, while the second is 2, lower. Then there's 新幹線 with a score of 3.\n",
      "\n",
      "I think the main rule here is to prioritize words that represent important readings. Since 線 (せん) appears twice with different scores, I should consider which one is more essential. The higher score of 4 suggests it's more important, so maybe that should be learned first. \n",
      "\n",
      "However, 新幹線 introduces a new kanji combination and might not directly relate to the same kanji as 線. So perhaps focusing on the more crucial reading for 線 makes sense.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, but 新幹線 is also an important word in itself. It's a common term meaning Shinkansen (bullet train). Even though its score is 3, it might be useful enough to include as an important word because it introduces multiple kanji together and is a high-frequency term.\n",
      "\n",
      "So I think 線 (せん,4) should definitely be in Important because of the higher importance. 新幹線 (しんかんせん,3) also seems like a good candidate for Important due to its common usage and relevance.\n",

The user provided a list of five words, each with their own reading and an importance score from 0 to 5. My task is to decide which ones should be learned directly after the kanji (important) and which should be learned later (not-important). \n",
      "\n",
      "First, I need to understand what criteria determine whether a word is important or not. The user mentioned that words learned directly after the kanji should only be useful and represent important readings. If a word isn't useful or doesn't show an important reading, it goes into the not-important list. Also, each kanji must have at least one important word to learn its most crucial reading.\n",
      "\n",
      "Looking at the provided words:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. 細胞 (さいぼう, 1)\n",
      "2. 細＊かい (こまかい, 3)\n",
      "3. 細*い (ほそい, 3)\n",
      "4. 詳細 (しょうさい, 1)\n",
      "5. 些細 (ささい, 1)\n",
      "\n",
      "Each of these words shares the kanji \"細\" or a variant with it. I need to analyze each one.\n",
      "\n",
      "Starting with 細胞 (さいぼう, 1). The reading is さいぼう, which means \"cell\" in biological terms. Since it's scored at 1, which is quite low, but it's directly associated with the kanji and represents a fundamental concept in science, I think this should be considered important.\n",
      "\n",
      "Next is 細＊かい (こまかい, 3). The reading here is こまかい, meaning \"small\" or \"minute.\" This is a common adjective and has a higher importance score of 3. It seems useful for general vocabulary, so it should be important.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then there's 細*い (ほそい, 3). The reading is ほそい, also meaning \"thin\" or \"narrow.\" Another high score of 3, which makes it quite useful as well. This word appears in various contexts and is likely essential to know.\n",
      "\n",
      "Next is 詳細 (しょうさい, 1). The reading is しょうさい, meaning \"detailed\" or \"detail.\" Scored at 1, but since it's a common word used frequently in both spoken and written language, especially in contexts like explanations or reports, it should be important to cover the main reading of the kanji.\n",
      "\n",
      "Lastly, 些細 (ささい, 1). The reading is ささい, meaning \"trivial\" or \"minor.\" Scored at 1, which might make me think it's less essential. However, it does represent another reading of the kanji and could be useful depending on context, but maybe not as critical as others.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, considering each kanji: 細 appears in all words except 詳細 (which uses 詳), so I need to ensure that for each kanji, at least one word is important. \n",
      "\n",
      "For 細胞, 細＊かい, and 細*い, they all share the 細 kanji. They have higher importance scores except for 細胞 which is 1, but it's a specific term. However, since each of these represents different readings (さい、こまかい、ほそい), they are all important to cover various uses of 細.\n",
      "\n",
      "For 詳細 and 些細, both use 詳 and 些 respectively. 詳 details the 詳 kanji with しょうさい, which is a common reading. 些細 has the ささい reading, but since it's scored lower and perhaps less commonly used, maybe it can be considered not-important unless necessary for covering that specific reading.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, no—each word might have its own kanji. Let me clarify: \n",
      "\n",
      "- 細胞 uses 細.\n",
      "- 細＊かい and 細*い also use 細.\n",
      "- 詳細 uses 詳.\n",
      "- 些細 uses 些.\n",
      "\n",
      "So each of these words is tied to a different kanji, but perhaps the user intended them all under one kanji? Hmm, maybe I misread. Let me check: The user said \"All words contain a certain kanji.\" So each word contains at least one kanji, which could be multiple in some cases.\n",
      "\n",
      "Looking again:\n",
      "\n",
      "- 細胞 (さいぼう): both 細 and 胚, but the main focus is on 細.\n",
      "- 細＊かい: uses 細 with a compound reading.\n",
      "- 細*い: same kanji 細.\n",
      "- 詳細: 詳 and 詳细 (but in Japanese, it's just 詳).\n",
      "- 些細: 些 and 細.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, perhaps the user is grouping words that share the same kanji. So each of these words has the kanji 細 or another kanji, but maybe I'm supposed to consider each word as part of a specific kanji's set. \n",
      "\n",
      "Alternatively, it might be that all these words are under the umbrella of the same root kanji, perhaps 細 or similar.\n",
      "\n",
      "But regardless, each word is its own entity with its own readings and importance scores.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, applying the criteria: Important words should be those that are useful and represent important readings. Not-important ones are less useful or don't cover critical readings.\n",
      "\n",
      "Given that:\n",
      "\n",
      "- 細胞 (1): Important as it's a key term in biology.\n",
      "- 細＊かい (3): Important due to high score and common use.\n",
      "- 細*い (3): Also important for similar reasons.\n",
      "- 詳細 (1): Important because it's a fundamental word.\n",
      "- 些细 (1): Maybe not as critical, but since it has the same kanji, perhaps it's necessary to include one of its readings.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me approach this step by step.\n",
      "\n",
      "Each word is tied to at least one kanji. The user wants to sort them into important and not-important based on their utility and whether they represent an important reading for the kanji they contain.\n",
      "\n",
      "The user's instruction was: \"The words that are learned directly after the kanji should only be words that are useful and words that represent important readings.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "So, for each kanji in a word, if the word is useful and represents an important reading of that kanji, it goes into Important. Otherwise, Not-important.\n",
      "\n",
      "But since some words have multiple kanji (like 細胞 has 細 and 胚), I might need to consider which kanji they're associated with primarily.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alternatively, perhaps each word is part of a set for one specific kanji, but the user hasn't specified that. So maybe all these words are under the same root kanji, say 細 or another.\n",
      "\n",
      "But without more context, it's tricky. Alternatively, perhaps each word is its own kanji lesson, so each word has its own kanji to learn, and I need to sort them as important or not based on their utility.\n",
      "\n",
      "In that case:\n",
      "\n",
      "- Important words: those with higher scores and are more commonly used.\n",
      "- Not-important: lower score and less common use.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, 細＊かい (3) and 細*い (3) would be important due to high scores. 細胞 (1) might still be important because it's a core term. 詳細 (1) is also important as a common word. 些细 (1) could go into not-important if it's less essential.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alternatively, maybe all words with score >=2 are important, and below that are not. But the scores here are low: max 3, min 1.\n",
      "\n",
      "But according to the user, even a score of 1 could be important if it represents an important reading for its kanji.\n",
      "\n",
      "Thus:\n",
      "\n",
      "Important:\n",
      "- 細胞 (important term)\n",
      "- 素＊かい (high utility)\n",
      "- 素*い (useful adjective)\n",
      "\n",
      "Not-important:\n",
      "- 詳細 (maybe important, but score is 1; perhaps not if it's too broad)\n",
      "Wait, no. 詳细 is a common word meaning detailed.\n",
      "\n",
      "I think all except maybe 些细 could be considered important because they have higher utility or are core terms.\n",
      "\n",
      "But I'm not sure about 些细—it might be less commonly used.\n",
      "\n",
      "Therefore, my final decision would be:\n",
      "\n",
      "Important: 素＊かい, 素*い, 素胞\n",
      "\n",
      "Not-important: 詳細, 些细\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, but in the initial analysis, I considered 素胞 as important because it's a core term. So perhaps all except 些细 are important.\n",
      "\n",
      "But maybe 些细 is also important because it contains the kanji 些, which might have that reading.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alternatively, if each word is part of its own kanji set, then for each kanji in the word:\n",
      "\n",
      "- For 素胞: focusing on 素\n",
      "- For 素＊かい and 素*い: also 素\n",
      "- For 詳细: 詳\n",
      "- For 些细: 些\n",
      "\n",
      "In that case, perhaps for each kanji set (素, 詳, 些), we need to pick the most important word.\n",
      "\n",
      "Thus:\n",
      "\n",
      "For 素: 素＊かい and 素*い are both important due to high scores.\n",
      "For 詳: 詳细 is a standard word, so important.\n",
      "For 些: 些细 may be less common, but it's still a reading. Maybe include one.\n",
      "\n",
      "But the user wants to sort all these words into two categories based on whether they're learned directly after the kanji, meaning if they represent an important reading for their respective kanji.\n",
      "\n",
      "Therefore:\n",
      "\n",
      "- 素＊かい: Important (common use)\n",
      "- 素*い: Important (useful adjective)\n",
      "- 詳细: Important (standard word)\n",
      "- 些细: Not-important (less common)\n",
      "\n",
      "But I'm still unsure about 些细. Alternatively, since each kanji needs at least one important word representing its main reading, perhaps:\n",
      "\n",
      "For 素: include both or either.\n",
      "For 詳: include 詳细.\n",
      "For 些: include 些细.\n",
      "\n",
      "Thus, all would be Important except none. But that can't be right because the user wants to sort them.\n",

The user mentioned that words to be learned directly after the kanji should only include those that are useful and represent important readings. If a word isn't useful or doesn't capture an essential reading, it goes into the Not-important list. Also, each kanji must have at least one important word associated with it to cover its most crucial reading.\n",
      "\n",
      "Looking at the provided words:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. 里 (さと, 2): This is a common word meaning \"village\" or \"hometown.\" The importance score is 2, which is relatively low but still useful.\n",
      "2. 芝 (しば, 3): Meaning \"grass,\" this is a basic vocabulary item, especially in compounds like 雑誌 (shibazashi). The score of 3 suggests it's moderately important.\n",
      "3. 方 (かた, 4): This kanji has multiple readings and meanings, but the given reading is \"kata\" meaning \"side\" or \"method.\" It's a useful word in various contexts, hence the higher importance score.\n",
      "4. 手 (て, 5): A very common word meaning \"hand\" or \"hand in,\" it's essential for basic communication with a high importance score of 5.\n",

      "\n",

The user provided four words with kanji, readings, and an importance score from 0 to 5. My task is to categorize them into \"Important\" and \"Not-important\" lists.\n",
      "\n",
      "First, let me understand the criteria again. The user wants some words learned directly after the kanji if they are useful and represent important readings. If a word isn't useful or doesn't show an important reading, it should be learned later. Also, each kanji must have at least one important word to learn its most crucial reading.\n",

      "Each of these has a kanji, reading, and importance score.\n",
      "\n",
      "I need to analyze each word's role in learning the kanji. The most important reading for each kanji should be covered by at least one word in the \"Important\" list.\n",
      "\n",
      "Starting with 童 (わらべ). The reading is \"warabe,\" which is a noun meaning child or children. It's a common word, but the importance score is 1, which is lower than others. However, since it might be essential for learning the kanji 童, I need to consider if there are other words that better represent important readings.\n",
      "\n",
      "Next, 童話 (どうわ) has the reading \"douwa\" and meaning \"fairy tale.\" The importance score is 2. This word uses the same kanji 童 but pairs it with 話. Since this is a compound word, it might be more advanced but still useful for understanding another reading of 童.\n",
      "\n",
      "童貞 (どうてい) reads as \"doutei\" and means \"bachelor.\" It's also scored 2. This word uses the same 童 kanji again but combines it with 貞. This could introduce a different meaning or context, which might be useful for expanding vocabulary but perhaps less essential than others.\n",
      "\n",
      "Finally, 児童 (じどう) reads as \"jidou\" and means \"child; minor.\" The score is 1. Here, the kanji is 児 instead of 童, so this word introduces a different kanji but relates to the same concept of child.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, actually, looking closer, all these words except 児童 use the kanji 童. So perhaps I need to check each kanji separately.\n",
      "\n",
      "Kanji 1: 童 appears in three words: 童 (わらべ), 童話 (どうわ), and 童貞 (どうてい). The readings are warabe, douwa, doutei. For the kanji 童, the most important reading would be \"warabe\" as it's a standalone noun. However, \"dou\" in 童話 might also be significant because it's a common prefix in compound words (like 童話, 童貞). So having both could help cover multiple readings.\n",
      "\n",
      "But I need to decide which is more important. The user's criteria suggest that if a word isn't useful or doesn't represent an important reading, it should be delayed. Since \"warabe\" is the basic meaning of 童, perhaps it's essential to include that as an important word. However, since it has a lower importance score (1), maybe the higher-scored words take precedence.\n",
      "\n",
      "Looking at scores: 童 (1), 童話 (2), 童貞 (2). So 童話 and 童貞 have higher scores. But should I include both? Or just one?\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, but each kanji might only need the most important reading represented first. The user says that at least one word should always be important to learn the most important reading of the word.\n",
      "\n",
      "So for 童 kanji: the most common and important reading is \"dou,\" as in 童話 and 童貞, which are both 2. So maybe those two should be in the important list because they represent the more significant readings beyond the basic \"warabe.\" But wait, warabe is a fundamental usage.\n",
      "\n",
      "Hmm, this is getting confusing. Let me think again.\n",
      "\n",
      "The user wants to sort words into Important and Not-important based on whether they are useful for learning the kanji's important readings. So if a word is not useful or doesn't show an important reading, it should be in Not-important.\n",
      "\n",
      "So 童 (わらべ) might be considered less important because it's just the basic meaning, but maybe it's still essential to know that kanji on its own means \"child.\" However, since there are higher-scored words with the same kanji that have more common or compound readings, perhaps those should take precedence.\n",
      "\n",
      "Looking at 児童 (じどう), it uses a different kanji: 児. So this is another kanji to learn, and its reading is \"jidou,\" meaning child/minor. The importance score is 1.\n",
      "\n",
      "So now, the list has two kanji: 童 and 児.\n",
      "\n",
      "For 童 kanji:\n",
      "\n",
      "- 童 (warabe, 1)\n",
      "- 童話 (douwa, 2)\n",
      "- 童貞 (doutei, 2)\n",
      "\n",
      "These three words share the same kanji. The user's criteria suggest that if a word is not useful or doesn't represent an important reading, it should be learned later.\n",
      "\n",
      "So perhaps 童 (warabe) is less important than the compound words because it's just a standalone noun. Or maybe the opposite—starting with the basic meaning is essential.\n",
      "\n",
      "But since the scores are 1 for warabe and 2 for the others, I might prioritize the higher-scored ones as more important.\n",
      "\n",
      "For 児童 (jidou), it introduces another kanji, 児, which has a similar meaning but different pronunciation. The score here is 1.\n",
      "\n",
      "So putting this together:\n",
      "\n",
      "Important: 童話, 童貞, 児童\n",
      "\n",
      "Not-important: 童\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, but that might not be correct because 童 itself uses the kanji and its reading is important as a standalone word. But since it's lower scored, maybe it should be learned later.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alternatively, perhaps 童 (warabe) should be in Important to cover the basic meaning, while the others are Not-important. But that might not align with the user's criteria if they want higher-scored words prioritized.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, let me check the user's instruction again: \"if a word is not useful or does not represent an important reading, it should be learned later.\" So I need to decide which words are useful and represent important readings.\n",
      "\n",
      "童 (warabe) is a basic word but perhaps less so than the compound words. The compounds 童話 and 童貞 have higher scores and may be more commonly used or have more significant readings for the kanji 童.\n",
      "\n",
      "But then, 児童 uses a different kanji, 児, which might need its own important word.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, but the user provided four words, all with either 童 or 児 as their main kanji. So perhaps I should separate them by kanji.\n",
      "\n",
      "Kanji 1: 童 appears in three words (童, 童話, 童貞). Kanji 2: 児 appears in one word (児童).\n",
      "\n",
      "For each kanji, at least one word must be Important to learn the most important reading.\n",
      "\n",
      "So for 童 kanji:\n",
      "\n",
      "- The most common readings are \"dou\" as in 童話 and 童貞. So those two should be considered Important because they represent the more prevalent readings.\n",
      "\n",
      "For 児 kanji:\n",
      "\n",
      "- Only one word, 児童 (jidou), so that must be Important to cover the main reading.\n",
      "\n",
      "But wait, if I include both 童話 and 童貞 as Important for 童 kanji, that's two words. But what about 童 itself? Since it's a standalone word with a lower score, maybe it can be Not-important, but according to the user's criteria, at least one word per kanji should be in Important.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, no—the user said \"at least one word\" should be in Important for each kanji. So for 童 kanji, we need at least one of its words in Important. Since both 童話 and 童貞 are higher-scored, either or both could be included. But to minimize the Important list, perhaps just one is enough.\n",
      "\n",
      "But I think the user wants all words that are useful for learning the kanji's important readings in Important, and others in Not-important.\n",
      "\n",
      "So perhaps:\n",
      "\n",
      "Important: 童話, 童貞 (both higher-scored and more commonly used), and 児童 (only word for 児 kanji).\n",
      "\n",
      "Not-important: 童\n",
      "\n",
      "But let me confirm: the user said \"if a word is not useful or does not represent an important reading, it should be learned later.\" So if a word isn't useful for learning the kanji's important readings, put it in Not-important.\n",
      "\n",
      "童 (warabe) may be less useful because it's just the standalone noun. The compound words are more essential for understanding how 童 is used in compounds.\n",
      "\n",
      "Therefore:\n",
      "\n",
      "Important: 童話, 童貞, 児童\n",
      "\n",
      "Not-important: 童\n",
      "\n",
      "Alternatively, maybe include both 童 and one of the others? Not sure.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, but the user might prefer that each kanji has at least one Important word. So for 童, we need to have at least one of its words in Important. Since all three are connected to 童, perhaps it's better to include the highest-scored ones and leave the lower-scored for later.\n",
      "\n",
      "So:\n",
      "\n",
      "Important: 童話 (2), 童貞 (2), 児童 (1)\n",
      "\n",
      "Not-important: 童 (1)\n",

      "But that leaves both kanji with Important words. However, the user might think that only one word per kanji is needed in Important. So perhaps pick the highest-scored for each.\n",
      "\n",
      "So for 童 kanji, choose either 童話 or 童貞 as Important; same with 児童 for 児 kanji.\n",
      "\n",
      "But then, both have higher scores than their standalone counterparts.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alternatively, include all higher-scored words in Important and leave the lower ones for later.\n",

      "Error processing answer: The answer must contain exactly two lines (after removing any <think> section): one starting with 'Important:' and one with 'Not-important:'.\n",
      "<think>\n",
      "Okay, so I need to figure out how to sort these Japanese words into important and not-important categories based on their readings and importance scores. Let me try to understand the problem step by step.\n",
      "\n",
      "First, the user is providing a list of words with their readings (kunrei or hiragana) and an importance score from 0 to 5. The goal is to create flashcards where some words are learned immediately after the kanji, and others later. \n",
      "\n",
      "The key point is that the words learned directly after the kanji should be useful and represent important readings. If a word isn't useful or doesn't show an important reading, it should be learned later. Also, every kanji should have at least one important word associated with it to cover its most essential reading.\n",
      "\n",
      "Let me look at the examples provided:\n",
      "\n",
      "Example 1:\n",
      "Given: 唯一 (ゆういち, 4)\n",
      "Response:\n",
      "Important: 唯一\n",
      "Not-important: \n",
      "\n",
      "In this case, since the importance score is high (4), it's placed in important.\n",
      "\n",
      "Example 2:\n",
      "Given: 一番 (いちばん, 5) → important\n",
      "二番 (にばん, 3) → not important\n",
      "三番 (さんばん, 1) → not important\n",
      "\n",
      "So here, even though the first word has a high score and is important, the others with lower scores are not.\n",
      "\n",
      "Another example:\n",
      "一*つ (ひとつ, 4) → important\n",
      "二つ (ふたつ, 3) → not important\n",
      "三つ (みっつ, 2) → not important\n",
      "\n",
      "Again, the highest scoring word in each kanji set is considered important.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, to generalize, for each kanji, I should select the word with the highest importance score as important. If a kanji has multiple words, only the one(s) with the top scores should be marked as important, and others go to not-important.\n",
      "\n",
      "But wait, sometimes even if another word in the same kanji group has a high score, do I need to consider all of them? For example, if a kanji has two words each with a 5, both would be important. But typically, each kanji is associated with one or a few readings, so perhaps each kanji only contributes once.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, looking at the examples, each line seems to represent a separate kanji. So each word is under its own kanji. For example:\n",
      "\n",
      "- 唯一 (ゆういち, 4) → Important\n",
      "- 一番 (いちばん,5), 二番(3), 三番(1) → Only 一番 is important.\n",
      "- Similarly, for the 一*つ group, only the first word is important.\n",
      "\n",
      "So perhaps each kanji is treated separately, and within each kanji's words, only the highest score is considered important. The rest go to not-important.\n",
      "\n",
      "But wait, in some cases, maybe a lower score could still be important if it's a common or essential reading even without the high score. But according to the instructions, I can rely on the importance scores provided or use my own judgment, but the examples suggest using the given scores as the main criteria.\n",
      "\n",
      "So perhaps for each kanji, only the word with the highest score is marked as important, and others are not, regardless of their scores.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alternatively, maybe if a word has an importance score of 4 or 5, it's important; otherwise, it's not. But in the examples, the user included words like 唯一 (4) as important, so perhaps any score above a certain threshold (like 3 or 4) is considered important.\n",
      "\n",
      "But since the example with 二番 (3) wasn't marked as important, maybe scores below a certain point are not important. But in another case, a word with a score of 2 was included, like 唯一 (2). Wait no, in the first example, it's 唯一 (ゆういち, 4), which is important.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, let me clarify:\n",
      "\n",
      "In the initial examples given by the user, they showed how to respond. For instance:\n",
      "\n",
      "Given: 唯一 (ゆういち, 4) → Important: 唯一\n",
      "Not-important: \n",
      "\n",
      "Another example:\n",
      "一*つ (ひとつ, 4) → Important: 一*つ\n",
      "二つ (ふたつ,3) → Not important\n",
      "三つ (さんばん,2) → Not important\n",
      "\n",
      "So it seems that for each kanji group, only the top word (highest score) is considered important, and others are not.\n",
      "\n",
      "But wait, in another example provided by the user:\n",
      "\n",
      "Another example:\n",

      "So that's how it's done.\n",
      "\n",
      "Therefore, for each kanji group, I need to select the word with the highest importance score as important, and all other words (even if they have high scores) are not. Wait no—actually, perhaps each line represents a separate kanji? Or is it per reading?\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, perhaps each line is a separate kanji plus its readings.\n",
      "\n",
      "But in any case, for each group of words under the same kanji, only the one with the highest importance score is marked as important, and others are not.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alternatively, maybe each word is treated separately regardless of kanji. But that seems less likely because the task involves associating words with their kanji.\n",
      "\n",

      "This suggests that for each kanji, certain words are associated. So perhaps for each kanji, I need to pick one or more important words based on their readings.\n",

      "\n",
      "Alternatively, maybe the user wants all words with non-zero importance scores to be considered important, but the examples show otherwise.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, in one example, 唯一 has a score of 2 and was still marked as important. So perhaps any word with an importance score greater than zero is important, but the examples contradict that because 二番 had a score of 3 and wasn't marked as important.\n",

      "Hmm, I'm getting confused.\n",

      "\n",
      "They said to respond with two lists. So each line is for a separate kanji? Or all words are considered together.\n",

      "But in their examples, they provided multiple lines, each starting with 重要 and 非重要, which suggests that each kanji group is handled separately.\n",
      "\n",
      "Therefore, perhaps for each kanji, the highest scoring word is important, and others are not.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, to proceed:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. For each kanji (each line), identify all its readings (words) with their scores.\n",
      "2. Among these, select the one(s) with the highest importance score as important.\n",
      "3. All other words for that kanji go into not-important.\n",
      "4. However, if a word's score is zero, it should be in not-important.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, but in the first example, 唯一 has a score of 2 and was marked as important. So perhaps any non-zero score makes it important, but I'm not sure because another word with a higher score wasn't included.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alternatively, maybe only words that are essential for the kanji's primary reading are considered important. But without knowing which reading is primary, it's hard to judge.\n",
      "\n",
      "Given the ambiguity, I think the safest approach is to follow the examples and treat each word separately, considering their own scores. So any word with a score of 4 or 5 is important, others are not.\n",
      "\n",
      "But wait, in one example, 唯一 (2) was marked as important, which contradicts that logic.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alternatively, perhaps all words are considered important regardless of their score because they were provided. But the examples show otherwise.\n",
      "\n",
      "I'm getting stuck here. Maybe I should proceed under the assumption that each word is treated separately and any with a non-zero importance score is important. So:\n",
      "\n",
      "- Important: all words where the score > 0\n",
      "- Not-important: none\n",
      "\n",
      "But in the examples, some words were marked as not important even though their scores were positive.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alternatively, perhaps only words with a score of 4 or higher are considered important.\n",
      "\n",
      "Given that in one example, 唯一 (2) was included in important, and another word with score 3 wasn't, I'm more confused now.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, looking at the user's initial message, they provided multiple examples:\n",
      "\n",

      "重要: 一*つ\n",
      "非重要: 二つ 三つ\n",

      "But in another part, they showed:\n",
      "\n",
      "For example, 唯一 (4) is important.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, perhaps the user is indicating that for each kanji group, only the top word (highest score) is considered important, and others are not. So:\n",
      "\n",
      "- For each kanji, select the word(s) with the highest importance score as important.\n",
      "- All other words for that kanji are non-important.\n",
      "\n",
      "Therefore, if a kanji has multiple words, only the one(s) with the maximum score in that group are marked as important.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, to implement this:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Group all words by their kanji (if possible; assuming each line is a different kanji).\n",
      "2. For each group, find the highest importance score.\n",
      "3. All words in that group with that highest score are marked as important.\n",
      "4. The rest are non-important.\n",
      "\n",
      "But I'm not entirely sure if the user intended this or if each word is independent.\n",
      "\n",
      "Given that the examples showed multiple words under the same kanji (e.g., 一*つ, 二つ, etc.), it's likely that for each kanji group, only the highest-scoring word is important, and others are not.\n",

      "\n",
      "First up is 歩道 (ほどう, 4). The reading here is \"hodou.\" Since it's a compound of 歩 (歩) and 道 (道), which I know means path or way. The score is 4, which is quite high, so this should definitely be marked as important.\n",
      "\n",
      "Next is 散歩 (さんぽ, 3). This word means walking, specifically taking a walk. It's another compound, but the score here is 3, still pretty decent. I think this is also important because it's commonly used and represents an essential reading of the kanji 歩.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then there's 步行者 (ほこうしゃ, 1). This word translates to pedestrian or someone who walks. The score is lower at 1, but it's a useful word as well. It does represent an important reading of 歩, so I might still consider it for the important list despite the low score.\n",
      "\n",
      "Lastly, 歩*く (あるく, 5). This one uses the kanji with a star, which I assume is a placeholder or indicates something else. The reading is \"arukusu,\" meaning to walk. The importance score here is the highest at 5, so this word is definitely important because it's fundamental for understanding the base meaning of 歩.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, considering the guidelines: words that are useful and represent important readings should be in the important list. 歩道 (4) and 散歩 (3) are both high utility and show key readings. 步行者 (1) is also useful but has a lower score, while 歩*く (5) is crucial as it's the basic form of the kanji.\n",

      "\n",
      "1. **通訳 (つうやく)**: This means \"interpreter\" or \"translation.\" The kanji here are 通 (tsū) meaning 'communication' and 訳 (yaku), which is part of the word 訳 meaning 'translation.' So, the reading for 訳 here is 'やく,' but in other words, like 翻訳, it's also read as 'やく.' But 通訳 has an importance score of 1, which seems low. Maybe not crucial.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **申し訳ない (もうしわけない)**: This means \"I'm sorry\" or \"excuse me.\" The kanji are 申 (mou), which is a less common character, and 討 (jie?), but wait, actually it's 申 + 辞? Wait no, the word is 申し訳ない. Let me think: 申 can be 'mou' or 'sもう', 理 is 'り,' but I'm getting confused here. Wait, maybe it's 申 (mou) and 討 (ken)? No, that doesn't seem right. Alternatively, perhaps it's 申し (mo shi) and 辭 (jien), but no, the correct kanji for 申し訳ない is 申 + 辞? Or is it 申 + 辞? Wait, I'm not sure about the exact breakdown, but the point is that this word is quite useful in daily conversation as a polite apology. The importance score is 3.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **翻訳 (ほんやく)**: This means \"translation.\" It's a common word used in contexts like translating documents or languages. The kanji are 翻 (hōn) meaning 'to turn over' or 'flipping,' and 訳 (yaku) as before. So this is definitely an important word for someone learning Japanese, especially if they're into reading or literature.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **言い訳 (いいわけ)**: This means \"excuse\" or \"pretext.\" It's a useful word but maybe not as common as others. The kanji are 言 (i) meaning 'word' and 辞 (kai?), but I think it's more about the structure of the word.\n",

      "5. **訳 (わけ)**: This is a standalone kanji meaning 'translation' or 'meaning.' It's read as 'wa' or 'yake' sometimes, but in this case, it's 'わ' and 'け.' The importance score here is 3, which seems low for such a fundamental kanji. However, since it's a single kanji, knowing its reading could be crucial for understanding other compound words.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, the task is to decide which of these should be learned directly after the kanji (important) and which can wait (not-important). The user mentioned that at least one word should always be important to learn the most important reading of the kanji. So I need to ensure that each kanji has at least one important word.\n",
      "\n",
      "Looking at the list, the words share some common kanji:\n",
      "\n",
      "- 通 (tsū) in 通訳\n",
      "- 申 (mou) in 申し訳ない\n",
      "- 翻 (hōn) in 翻訳\n",
      "- 言 (i) in 言い訳\n",
      "- 辞 (kai?) in some words, but not sure\n",
      "- 訳 (yaku) appears in multiple words.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, actually, the kanji 通 is only in 通訳. The kanji 申 is only in 申し訳ない. 翻 is only in 翻訳. 言 is in 言い訳 and maybe others? No, 言 is also part of other words like 言う (i u), but that's not here. The kanji 訳 appears in 通訳, 翻訳, 言い訳, and 訳.\n",
      "\n",
      "So each word introduces a different kanji or combination. Therefore, for each kanji, we might need at least one important word to learn its primary reading.\n",
      "\n",
      "Let me go through each kanji:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. 通 (tsū) in 通訳: The only word with this kanji is 通訳, which has a low importance score of 1. But since it's the only word for 通, I think we should include it as important to learn the reading 'tsū.'\n",
      "\n",
      "2. 申 (mou) in 申し訳ない: This word is a polite expression used often. It has an importance score of 3, which isn't high but still useful.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. 翻 (hōn) in 翻訳: This kanji is part of 'flipping' or 'turning over,' and the word means translation, which is quite important for learners.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. 言 (i) in 言い訳: This word means excuse, so it's useful but maybe not as essential as others. However, since 言 appears in other words like 言う (i u), which isn't here, we might need to include this if it helps with the kanji.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. 訳 (yaku) in several words: This is a key kanji meaning 'translation.' It's present in multiple words, so knowing it is crucial.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, but each word may have multiple kanji. For example, 通訳 has two kanji: 通 and 訳. So for each of these, we need to see if the word helps learn their readings.\n",
      "\n",
      "But perhaps I should think about which words teach the most important readings for their kanji. \n",
      "\n",
      "Starting with 通 (tsū). The only word is 通訳, so it's essential to include that as important to learn 'tsū.'\n",
      "\n",
      "Next, 申 (mou) in 申し訳ない: This word might be a good way to learn the reading of 申 as 'mou.' However, since it's a longer expression and less common, maybe not as crucial. But given that it's an apology phrase, which is useful, perhaps it should be important.\n",
      "\n",
      "For 翻 (hōn) in 翻訳: This word is quite important because it's commonly used for translation. So including this would help learn 'hōn' and 'yaku,' but since 訳 is also present in other words, maybe focusing on the most useful ones.\n",
      "\n",
      "言 (i) in 言い訳: This word might be less common than others, so perhaps not as important.\n",
      "\n",
      "Finally, 訳 (yaku): It's a standalone kanji and appears in multiple words. So at least one of those words should be included to learn 'yaku.'\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, considering all this:\n",
      "\n",
      "- 通訳 is essential for 通.\n",
      "- 翻訳 is essential for 翻 and 言? Wait, no, 言 is in 言い訳.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, maybe I need to separate the kanji. Let's list out each kanji present:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. 通\n",
      "2. 申\n",
      "3. 翻\n",
      "4. 言\n",
      "5. 訳\n",
      "\n",
      "Each of these kanji appears only in specific words:\n",
      "\n",
      "- 通: 通訳\n",
      "- 申: 申し訳ない\n",
      "- 翻: 翻訳\n",
      "- 言: 言い訳\n",
      "- 訳: 通訳, 翻訳, 言い訳, 訳\n",
      "\n",
      "So for each kanji except 訳, there's only one word. Therefore, those words (通訳, 申し訳ない, 翻訳, 言い訳) should be considered important because they are the primary way to learn their respective kanji.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, since 訳 appears in multiple words, we need to decide which of those words is most essential. The word 訳 itself is a standalone kanji and knowing its reading can help with other words like 通訳 and 翻訳. But given that it's the simplest form, perhaps including 訳 as important would be better.\n",
      "\n",
      "But wait, the user provided all these words as options, so maybe they are considering each word separately for their kanji components. So to cover each kanji properly, we need at least one of the words containing it to be important.\n",
      "\n",
      "Therefore:\n",
      "\n",
      "- 通訳 (important for 通)\n",
      "- 申し訳ない (important for 申)\n",
      "- 翻訳 (important for 翻 and 言? Wait, no. 翻 is in 翻訳, and 言 is in 言い訳.)\n",
      "\n",
      "So each of these four words (通訳, 申し訳ない, 翻訳, 言い訳) should be important to learn their respective kanji.\n",
      "\n",
      "The word 訳 alone could also be included as it's a single kanji, but since the others are already covering the necessary readings for other kanji, maybe including 訳 is optional. However, if we include 訳, it helps in understanding 'yaku' which is used widely.\n",
      "\n",
      "But considering the user mentioned at least one word should be important to learn the most important reading of each kanji, perhaps all four words (通訳, 申し訳ない, 翻訳, 言い訳) are essential. But that might be too many.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alternatively, prioritize based on usage and importance:\n",
      "\n",
      "- 翻訳 is very common in Japanese for translation.\n",
      "- 通訳 is also common but less so than 翻訳.\n",
      "- 申し訳ない is polite and useful but not as frequently used as the others.\n",
      "- 言い訳 is less common.\n",
      "\n",
      "Therefore, perhaps include 翻訳 and 通訳 as important. But then what about 申 and 言? They might be neglected.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alternatively, since each word contains unique kanji:\n",
      "\n",
      "- 通訳 for 通\n",
      "- 申し訳ない for 申\n",
      "- 翻訳 for 翻\n",
      "- 言い訳 for 言\n",
      "- And maybe 訳 as an extra.\n",
      "\n",
      "But the user might not want all of them to be important. Maybe select the top ones based on utility.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alternatively, perhaps only include the words that are most essential:\n",
      "\n",
      "- 翻訳 (important for 'translation')\n",
      "- 通訳 (for 'conveying' meaning)\n",
      "- 申し訳ない (politeness)\n",
      "\n",
      "But I think the user wants a selection where at least one word per kanji is important. So if each of these words introduces a unique kanji, then all should be considered important.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, considering the importance and frequency:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. 翻訳: High\n",
      "2. 通訳: Medium\n",
      "3. 申し訳ない: Lower but useful\n",
      "4. 言い訳: Lower\n",
      "\n",
      "So perhaps prioritize the top two as important, but then we miss some kanji.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alternatively, since each word contains a unique kanji (except 訳), we need to include all four words as important to cover all kanji readings.\n",
      "\n",
      "But that might not be necessary if some kanji can be learned through other means. However, given the context, I think it's safe to assume that the user wants at least one word per kanji to be marked as important.\n",
      "\n",
      "Therefore, the final answer would include:\n",
      "\n",
      "- 通訳 (important for 通)\n",
      "- 申し訳ない (important for 申)\n",
      "- 翻訳 (important for 翻 and 言? Wait no, 言 is in another word.)\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, each kanji is covered by a specific word. So:\n",
      "\n",
      "- 通: 通訳\n",
      "- 申: 申し訳ない\n",
      "- 翻: 翻訳\n",
      "- 言: 言い訳\n",
      "\n",
      "Thus, all four words should be considered important to cover each kanji's main reading.\n",
      "\n",
      "But the user might prefer a more concise selection. Alternatively, perhaps only the top two are necessary, but then some kanji would not have their readings covered.\n",
      "\n",
      "I think it's better to include all four as important to ensure each kanji is properly learned.\n",
      "</think>\n",
      "\n",
      "To ensure that each kanji is properly covered with its most important reading, all four words provided should be considered essential. This approach ensures comprehensive learning of each character:\n",

      "- **通訳 (Tsūyakusha)**: Important for the kanji 通 (tsū).\n",
      "- **申し訳ない (Mōshiwake nai)**: Important for the kanji 申 (mōshi).\n",
      "- **翻訳 (Honyaku)**: Important for the kanji 翻 (honyaku) and 言 (wa in this context, but primarily for 翻).\n",
      "- **言い訳 (Iyowakusha)**: Important for the kanji 言 (wa).\n",

      "First, let me understand what each part means. Each entry has a kanji with its reading(s) and an importance score. My task is to decide which words should be learned directly after the kanji (important) and which ones should be learned later (not-important). The key points are:\n",

      "1. Important words are those that are useful or represent important readings.\n",
      "2. If a word isn't useful or doesn't show an important reading, it goes into not-important.\n",

      "\n",
      "Looking at the examples given:\n",
      "\n",
      "- 打*つ (うつ, 3): The user classified this as important and placed it in the Important list. So, I guess that even though the score is a mid-level 3, the reading might be critical for understanding or usage frequency.\n",
      "  \n",
      "- 一*つ (ひとつ, 4): This was not included in either list, so perhaps it's considered less important or maybe it was omitted by mistake, but since the user didn't include it, I shouldn't add it unless it's clearly important.\n",
      "\n",
      "I need to consider each word's importance score and whether its reading is significant. For example, if a kanji has multiple readings, only the most important ones should be highlighted early. If a word's primary use or high-frequency reading isn't covered, it might go into not-important.\n",
      "\n",
      "Also, I must ensure that for any kanji, at least one of its words is marked as important to cover the essential reading, especially if the kanji itself is less important.\n",

      "- Check the importance score. Higher scores likely mean more important.\n",

      "- Determine if the reading represents a primary or common usage of that kanji.\n",
      "\n",
      "I should go through each provided word, apply these criteria, and then sort them accordingly, making sure to include only the necessary words in the Important list and others in Not-important.

      "If there's uncertainty about a word's importance, perhaps leaning towards classifying it as important if its score is 3 or above, since lower scores might indicate less priority. But I should also consider the kanji's overall significance in Japanese.\n",

      "5. 最低 (さいてい, 3) – \"Lowest\" or \"minimum.\" A mid-level score here, but still useful as it captures another reading of the kanji.\n",
      "6. 最初の (さいしょ, 2) – This is a grammatical form meaning \"first.\" The score is lower, so perhaps not as critical on its own, but since it uses the same kanji and reading as 最初, maybe it's still useful to know for grammar.\n",
      "7. 最悪 (さいあく, 3) – \"Worst\" or \"extremely bad.\" Another mid-level score, but useful in contexts like 最悪の状況 (worst situation).\n",
      "8. 最*も (もっとも, 3) – This seems to be a variation of \"most,\" as in the adverbial form. The star might represent a different character or a grammatical particle. Given that it's an important reading but perhaps less so on its own.\n",
      "\n",
      "The user also mentioned that some words are learned directly after the kanji if they're useful and represent important readings, while others can be delayed.\n",
      "\n",
      "I think the key here is to identify which words best capture the primary readings of their kanji. The kanji in all these words is \"最\" (さい), meaning \"most\" or \"extreme.\" Each word adds a different suffix to this base reading.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, the important words should include those that represent the core meanings and are high-frequency. Words with lower scores but still useful might be considered not-important for immediate learning but could be added later.\n",
      "\n",
      "Looking at the list:\n",
      "\n",
      "- 最高 (さいこう!, 5) – Very important.\n",
      "- 最初 (さいしょ, 5) – Important.\n",
      "- 最後 (さいご, 5) – Important.\n",
      "- 最近 (さいきん, 4) – Important as it's a common word.\n",
      "- 最低 (さいてい, 3) – Still useful and represents another important reading.\n",
      "\n",
      "The lower-scored words:\n",
      "\n",
      "- 最初の (さいしょ, 2) – While it shares the same kanji and reading as 最初, it's more of a grammatical form and might be learned later once basic forms are covered.\n",
      "- 最悪 (さいあく, 3) – Useful but perhaps not as critical as the higher-scored ones.\n",
      "- 最*も (もっとも, 3) – The star indicates maybe an alternative or less common usage. Since it's a lower score, it might be better to learn this later.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, for Important: I'll include those with high scores and core meanings—最高, 最初, 最後, 最近, 最低. These are all crucial readings of the kanji \"最\" and have high importance scores.\n",
      "\n",
      "For Not-important: The remaining ones are 最初の, 最悪, and 最*も. They're still useful but perhaps not as critical for initial learning. However, I notice that all Important words are already covering the core readings, so maybe it's better to include one more from these if possible, but given their lower scores, they might be better suited for later.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, but according to the user’s note, at least one word should always be important to learn the most important reading. So perhaps I need to ensure that each kanji has at least one important word, but in this case, all these words share the same kanji \"最,\" so they might be grouped under that single kanji.\n",
      "\n",
      "But since the user is asking for the words as separate entities, I think it's acceptable to categorize them based on their own importance regardless of kanji grouping.\n",
      "\n",
      "Therefore, I'll proceed with:\n",
      "\n",

      "<think>\n",
      "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how to sort these Japanese words into important and not-important categories based on their readings and importance scores. Let me go through each word one by one.\n",
      "\n",
      "First, the list given is:\n",
      "1. 聞＊こえる (きこえる, 3)\n",
      "2. 聰＊く (きく, 4)\n",
      "3. 聪＊く (きく, 3)\n",
      "4. 盗み聞き (ぬすみぎき, 1)\n",
      "5. 新聞 (しんぶん, 3)\n",
      "\n",
      "I need to determine which of these should be learned directly after the kanji and which should be learned later.\n",
      "\n",
      "Starting with 聞＊こえる (きこえる, 3). The kanji here is 聴, which I know usually relates to hearing. The reading is \"kikaueru,\" which means \"can hear\" or \"is heard.\" This seems useful because it's a common verb form and represents an important reading for the kanji 聴.\n",
      "\n",
      "Next is 聰＊く (きく, 4). The kanji here is 聡, which I'm less familiar with. From what I remember, 聡 can mean to hear or listen, similar to 聴. The reading \"kiku\" here might be a verb form as well, perhaps meaning to ask or inquire. Since it's a high importance score (4), it's definitely important.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then there's 聪＊く (きく, 3). This is another instance of the kanji 聡 with the same reading \"kiku.\" It might be a different verb form or nuance. The lower importance score (3) suggests it's still useful but perhaps not as critical as the one with a higher score.\n",
      "\n",
      "Moving on to 盗み聞き (ぬすみぎき, 1). This word means \"eavesdropping\" and uses two kanji: 盗 (nusumi, thief or steal) and 聴 (ki, hear). The importance score is only 1, which is the lowest. Since it's a compound term that might not be as commonly used, it probably should be learned later.\n",
      "\n",
      "Lastly, 新聞 (しんぶん, 3) means \"newspaper.\" It uses two kanji: 新 (shin, new) and 舫 (bun, article or news). This is a very common word in Japanese, so it's definitely important to learn early. However, since the task is to sort based on the kanji they contain, I need to see which kanji are present here.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, each entry should be based on the kanji they contain. So for each word, I have to look at the main kanji and decide if the word is an important reading for that kanji or not.\n",
      "\n",
      "Let me reevaluate:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. 聞＊こえる: kanji 聴 with reading きこえる. Important score 3.\n",
      "2. 聰＊く: kanji 聡 with reading きく. Score 4.\n",
      "3. 聪＊く: same kanji 聡, reading きく. Score 3.\n",
      "4. 盗み聞き: kanji 盗 and 聴. But the focus is on which kanji to associate it with? Or perhaps both? Since the task is per word, I think each entry is tied to a specific kanji, so maybe this word is linked to either 盗 or 聴. Not sure, but since it's low importance (1), it might be better as not-important.\n",
      "5. 新聞: kanji 新 and 舫. Both are important, but the word itself is very common.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Each entry is a word with its own kanji(s). The task is to decide for each word whether it should be learned directly after the kanji or later. So, if the word represents an important reading of its kanji and is useful, it goes in Important; otherwise, Not-important.\n",
      "\n",
      "So:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. 聞＊こえる: uses 聴 with きこえる. This is a key verb for 聴, so important.\n",
      "2. 聰＊く: 聡 with きく. Since the score is high (4), it's important.\n",
      "3. 聪＊く: same as above but lower score (3). However, since both are readings of 聡, maybe only one needs to be selected? Or perhaps both should be considered. But per instructions, all words may be classified as important. So I might include both in Important or decide based on their utility.\n",
      "4. 盗み聞き: low importance score (1), so probably not important for initial learning.\n",
      "5. 新聞: high utility word but tied to kanji 新 and 舫. However, the task is per word, so as a word, it's important.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, no—each entry is a word with its own kanji(s). So each of these entries is a separate word linked to their respective kanji.\n",
      "\n",
      "But I think I might be misunderstanding. Each word contains a certain kanji, but perhaps some words are more directly tied to one kanji than others.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alternatively, maybe the user provided all words that contain any of the kanji, and now we need to sort them into important or not based on their readings and importance scores for the kanji they contain.\n",
      "\n",
      "In that case:\n",
      "\n",
      "- 聞＊こえる: For the kanji 聴, きこえる is an important reading.\n",
      "- 聰＊く: For 聡, きく is a common reading (as in 智 or 賢).\n",
      "Wait, no—聡 itself is read as \"sou\" or \"sei,\" but maybe the user provided it as きく? That seems off. Perhaps I'm misremembering.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, the user wrote:\n",
      "\n",
      "The words are: 聞＊こえる (きこえる, 3), 聰＊く (きく, 4), 聴＊く (きく, 3), 盗み聞き (ぬすみぎき, 1), 新聞 (しんぶん, 3)\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, I think there's a mistake in the third word: it should be 聡＊く, but maybe the user meant 聴＊く? Or perhaps they made an error. Because 聰 is different from 聡.\n",
      "\n",
      "Assuming that the third word is indeed 聡＊く (きく, 3), then:\n",
      "\n",
      "- For kanji 聡, \"ki\" isn't a standard reading. Typically, 聡 is read as \"sou\" or \"sei.\" So perhaps this is incorrect. Maybe it's supposed to be 聴＊く?\n",
      "\n",
      "But I'll proceed with what the user provided.\n",
      "\n",
      "So for each word:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. 聞＊こえる: kanji 聴, reading きこえる (kikaueru), importance 3.\n",
      "2. 聰＊く: kanji 聡, reading きく (kiku), importance 4.\n",
      "3. 聪＊く: kanji 聡, reading きく (kiku), importance 3.\n",
      "4. 盗み聞き: kanji 盗 and 聴, reading ぬすみぎき, importance 1.\n",
      "5. 新聞: kanji 新 and 舫, reading しんぶん, importance 3.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, the goal is to assign these words as Important or Not-important based on whether they should be learned directly after their respective kanji.\n",
      "\n",
      "For each kanji in the word:\n",
      "\n",
      "- If a word's reading is an important or common one for that kanji, it should go into Important.\n",
      "- If the word's reading isn't commonly used or if the word itself isn't useful, it goes to Not-important.\n",
      "\n",
      "So:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. 聞＊こえる: For 聴, きこえる is a verb meaning \"to listen.\" It's a core verb, so important.\n",
      "2. 聰＊く: For 聡, きく is not a standard reading. Perhaps this is an error; maybe it should be another kanji. But assuming it's correct, since the importance score is high (4), perhaps include it.\n",
      "3. 聪＊く: Same as above, but lower score (3). If both are incorrect readings for their kanji, then they might not be important, but per instructions, all may be considered important.\n",
      "4. 盗み聞き: For 盗, the reading is ぬすみ, which is correct. But the word itself is a compound with 聴. Since it's low importance (1), maybe not important for initial learning.\n",
      "5. 新聞: High utility word, so important.\n",
      "\n",
      "But I'm getting confused because each entry is tied to one kanji. Maybe:\n",
      "\n",
      "- Each word is linked to its main kanji, so:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. 〜こえる is linked to 聴.\n",
      "2. 〜く is linked to 聡 (but that's an unusual reading).\n",
      "3. 〜く is linked to 聡 again.\n",
      "4. 盗み聞き is linked to both 盗 and 聴, but perhaps primarily to 盗 or 聴? Maybe it's better to split them into separate entries.\n",
      "\n",
      "But the user provided them as a single word.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alternatively, maybe I should treat each entry as a separate word with its own kanji(s), regardless of whether they share a kanji. So:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. 〜こえる: important for 聴.\n",
      "2. 〜く: perhaps less common for 聡, but with high importance score.\n",
      "3. 〜く: same as above, lower score.\n",
      "4. 盗み聞き: low importance, so not important.\n",
      "5. 新聞: important.\n",
      "\n",
      "But I'm overcomplicating again. Maybe the best approach is to assign each word to Important if its reading is a primary one for its kanji and it's high utility; otherwise, Not-important.\n",
      "\n",
      "So:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. 聞＊こえる: Yes, important.\n",
      "2. 聰＊く: No, since きく isn't standard for 聡; but since score is 4, maybe include.\n",
      "3. 聪＊く: Same as above, maybe exclude or include based on that.\n",
      "But the user said all may be considered important.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, the instructions say:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Please provide a detailed thought process to determine whether each word should be classified as 'Important' or 'Not-important' for language learning purposes.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "So I need to evaluate each word individually.\n",
      "\n",
      "1. 聞＊こえる: verb meaning \"to listen.\" Common and useful. Important.\n",
      "2. 聰＊く: For 聡, which is usually read as \"sou\" or \"sei,\" きく is not standard. So this might be an error, but with a high importance score (4), perhaps it's considered important despite the reading issue.\n",
      "3. 聪＊く: Same as above, but lower score. Probably Not-important.\n",
      "4. 盗み聞き: means \"eavesdropping.\" Useful in specific contexts but less common. With low importance (1), probably Not-important.\n",
      "5. 新聞: a fundamental word meaning \"newspaper.\" Highly important.\n",
      "\n",
      "But wait, maybe I should check each kanji's primary readings:\n",
      "\n",
      "- 聴 (きく): Common reading for listening-related verbs.\n",
      "- 聡 (sou/sei): Doesn't have きく as a standard reading. So any words with きく for 聡 are likely incorrect or rare.\n",
      "\n",
      "Thus, entries 2 and 3 are probably errors in readings, so they shouldn't be considered important. Only the first and last should be Important.\n",
      "\n",
      "But since the user instructed that all may be considered important, I'm confused. Maybe it's better to proceed as per instructions.\n",

      "\n",
      "First, I'm given three words with their kanji, readings, and an importance score. The task is to decide which should be learned immediately after the kanji (important) and which can be learned later (not-important). \n",
      "\n",
      "The words provided are:\n",
      "1. 迫*る (せまる, 3)\n",
      "2. 迫害 (はくがい, 1)\n",
      "3. 圧迫 (あっぱく, 2)\n",
      "\n",
      "I need to figure out the kanji each word contains because each word has a certain kanji. Let's break them down.\n",
      "\n",
      "- 迫*る: The main kanji here is 迫 (せまる). The * probably indicates that it's the main part of the word.\n",
      "- 迫害: This is hukgaru in reading, but I think the kanji are 迫 and 害. So it's two kanji.\n",
      "- 圧迫: The kanji is 圧 (atsu) and another 导? Wait, no, 圧迫 is atsappaku, so the kanji are 圧 and 逼.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, let me confirm each word:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. 迫*る: The main kanji is 迫. It's read as \"semaru\" in Japanese, which can mean to press, urge, or compel.\n",
      "2. 迫害 (はくがい): This means persecution. So the kanji are 迫 (huku) and 害 (gai). Wait, but the reading given is はくがい, so huku is 迫? Or wait, maybe I'm mixing up. Let me check: 迫害 is \"迫害\" which is hakukan in some contexts, but the user provided はくがい as the reading. So it's likely that 迫 is read as \"はく\" and 害 as \"がい\", making it はくがい.\n",
      "3. 圧迫 (あっぱく): This means oppression or pressure. The kanji are 圧 (atsu) and 逼 (paku?), but the reading given is あっぱく, which would be a combination of 圧 (atsu) and another character. Alternatively, maybe it's 圧 plus 逼, but I'm not sure about the exact readings.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, perhaps I should look up each kanji to understand their readings better because that might affect whether the word is considered important or not.\n",
      "\n",
      "Starting with 迫:\n",
      "- 迫 can be read as せまる (to press, urge) and はく in compounds like 迫害 (はくがい). So for 迫*る, it's せまる, which is a common reading meaning to approach or press closely.\n",
      "\n",
      "迫害: 迫 (はく) 害 (がい), so はくがい. This means persecution, which is an important term in certain contexts but perhaps less commonly used day-to-day.\n",
      "\n",
      "圧迫: 圧 (あつ) and 逼 (ぱく?), making the reading あっぱく. It's a more formal or literary term meaning oppression or pressure.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, considering the importance scores:\n",
      "- 迫*る (せまる, 3): score of 3.\n",
      "- 迫害 (はくがい, 1): score of 1.\n",
      "- 圧迫 (あっぱく, 2): score of 2.\n",
      "\n",
      "The instruction says that important words are those that represent important readings. So, if a word's reading is crucial for understanding the kanji, it should be learned first. Otherwise, it can be learned later.\n",
      "\n",
      "Looking at each:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. 迫*る (せまる, 3): This is a common verb meaning to press or urge someone. It uses the main reading of 迫 as せまる, which is likely more essential than the はく reading used in 迫害. So knowing 迫*る would help learn the basic reading of 迫.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. 迫害 (はくがい, 1): This is a compound using 迫 and 害. Since it's read as はくがい, which is a less common reading for 迫 compared to せまる, this word might be learned later once the basic reading of 迫 is known.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. 圧迫 (あっぱく, 2): This uses the kanji 圧 and 逼. The score is 2, so it's more important than not, but perhaps less so than 迫*る. It's a formal term, so maybe it can be learned later as well.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, I need to decide which words should be marked as important. The rule says that at least one word per kanji should be an important reading. So for each kanji, if the word is an important reading, it goes in Important; otherwise, Not-important.\n",
      "\n",
      "Looking at 迫*る: It uses the main reading せまる of 迫, which is probably essential to learn the kanji. So this should go into Important.\n",
      "\n",
      "迫害: Uses the はく reading of 迫, which might be a secondary or less common reading. Since there's already an important word for 迫 (迫*る), 迫害 can be Not-important.\n",
      "\n",
      "圧迫: Uses 圧 and 逼. The reading あっぱく is not as common as other readings like 圧力 (atsu ryoku, pressure). So perhaps it's better to learn this later if needed. But the score is 2, which might make it more important than a 1 or lower. However, since the user wants to prioritize words that represent important readings, maybe it's better to include it in Important as well because it introduces another reading of 圧 and 逼.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, but I'm not sure about the importance of each word based on their scores. The higher the score, the more important. So:\n",
      "\n",
      "- 迫*る: 3\n",
      "- 圧迫: 2\n",
      "- 迫害: 1\n",
      "\n",
      "So perhaps both 迫*る and 圧迫 should be in Important because they have higher scores, while 迫害 is lower.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alternatively, maybe only the highest score per kanji is important. But each word has different kanji:\n",
      "\n",
      "- 迫*る: main kanji 迫\n",
      "- 迫害: main kanji 迫 and 害 (but since it's a compound, perhaps both)\n",
      "- 圧迫: main kanji 圧\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, but I'm not sure if each word is associated with only one kanji or multiple. The user said \"All words contain a certain kanji,\" which might mean that each word has a single key kanji to focus on, even if it's part of a compound.\n",
      "\n",
      "So perhaps:\n",
      "\n",
      "- 迫*る: focuses on 迫\n",
      "- 迫害: focuses on 迫 (since the other kanji is 害)\n",
      "- 圧迫: focuses on 圧\n",
      "\n",
      "But I'm not certain about that. It might be better to consider each word as its own, regardless of the number of kanji.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, for sorting:\n",
      "\n",
      "Important words should have higher importance scores and represent key readings of their kanji.\n",
      "\n",
      "Therefore, 迫*る (3) and 圧迫 (2) would go into Important because they have higher scores and likely cover essential readings. 迫害 (1) could be Not-important as it's a lower score and perhaps less common.\n",
      "\n",
      "But wait, the user said \"the words that are learned directly after the kanji should only be words that are useful and represent important readings.\" So for each kanji, we need to pick one word that teaches an important reading. \n",
      "\n",
      "Looking at 迫*る: It's a verb with せまる, which is likely more essential than the はく reading used in 迫害.\n",
      "\n",
      "For 圧: The main reading might be 圧力 (atsu ryoku), but 圧迫 uses あっぱく, which is also important. Maybe both are needed, so including 圧迫 as Important makes sense.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, I think:\n",
      "\n",
      "Important:\n",
      "- 迫*る (せまる)\n",
      "- 圧迫 (あっぱく)\n",
      "\n",
      "Not-important:\n",
      "- 迫害 (はくがい)\n",
      "\n",
      "Alternatively, if only the highest per kanji is chosen, and since 迫*る covers 迫's main reading, then 迫害 can be Not-important. Similarly, 圧迫 covers 圧's reading.\n",
      "\n",
      "So I'll go with that.\n",

      "I think the key here is to determine which readings are essential for understanding the kanji itself. For example, if a word's reading directly represents a common or fundamental meaning of its kanji, it should probably be marked as important. On the other hand, if the word is less commonly used or doesn't capture an important aspect of the kanji, it might be better to leave it for later.\n",
      "\n",
      "Let me analyze each word:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. 全体 (ぜんたい): The kanji here are 全 and 体. I know that 体 on its own means \"body.\" This word means \"whole\" or \"entire body.\" It's a common term, but the importance score is only 2. Maybe not critical.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. 死体 (したい): The kanji are 死 (death) and 体 (body). So this means \"dead body,\" which is quite literal. The reading might be important for understanding 死 combined with 体. Importance score is 3, which is higher than the first one.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. 体育 (たいいく): This is a compound of 体 (body) and 运 (movement), meaning \"physical education.\" However, the reading here uses a different on-yomi for 体 (たい). The word itself might be important because it's related to sports, but the score is only 1.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. 体重 (たいじゅう): Combines 体 (body) and 重 (weight), meaning \"weight.\" This is a useful term in everyday language, so learning this reading could be essential for the kanji 体. The importance score is 2.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. 具体的 (ぐたいてき): This word means \"specific\" or \"concrete.\" It uses the kanji 具 and 体. The reading here is more complex, but since it's an adjective, maybe not as critical unless it's a common term. Score is 3.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. 液体 (えきたい): Combines 液 (liquid) and 体 (body), meaning \"liquid.\" This is a basic scientific term, so learning this reading could be important for the kanji 液. The importance score is 3.\n",
      "\n",
      "7. 体 (からだ): Just the single kanji 体, which means \"body.\" This is fundamental; without understanding this, it's hard to grasp other compound words with 体. The high score of 5 makes it clearly important.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, considering that some words may be learned later if they don't represent the most critical reading or usage for their kanji. For instance, if a kanji has multiple readings and one is more essential than others, only that should be prioritized.\n",
      "\n",
      "Looking at each kanji:\n",
      "\n",
      "- 体 appears in several words: 全体、体育、体重、具体的、液体、体. The most important reading here would likely be 体 itself (からだ), which scores 5. Other readings like たい in 体育 and たい in 液体 might also be significant because they're common on-yomi for 体, but the word 体 alone is the foundation.\n",
      "\n",
      "- 具 appears only in 具体的 (ぐたいてき). Since this word has a score of 3, it's important enough to include it as important because it's likely the primary way to learn the reading for 具.\n",
      "\n",
      "- 死 in 死体 (したい) is combined with 体. The reading might be crucial for understanding 死 on its own or in other compounds, but since the score is 3 and it's a straightforward combination, it could be considered important.\n",
      "\n",
      "- 液 in 液体 (えきたい) is another fundamental kanji, so learning this word would help grasp its meaning as \"liquid.\" The score of 3 supports including it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, let me try to assign each word to either Important or Not-important:\n",
      "\n",
      "Important should include words that are essential for understanding the kanji's core readings or have high importance scores. \n",
      "\n",
      "- 体 (からだ) is definitely important with a high score.\n",
      "- 具体的 might be important because it uses 具, and its reading could help in understanding that kanji.\n",
      "- 死体 is important because it combines 死 and 体, both of which are significant kanji on their own, and the word itself is quite direct.\n",
      "- 液体 is important as it's a basic term for liquid, and the kanji 液 is fundamental.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, looking at the other words:\n",
      "\n",
      "- 全体: While useful, its importance score is 2. Maybe not as critical compared to others with higher scores or more foundational meanings.\n",
      "- 体育: With a low score of 1, perhaps it's better learned later.\n",
      "- 体重: Importance score of 2; maybe it could be important but perhaps less so than the others.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, but I need to ensure that at least one word for each kanji has an important reading. For example, if only 体 is considered important, but other words with 体 might still need to be learned later.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alternatively, perhaps all words except those with lower scores should be in Important, but the user's instruction was to sort them based on whether they should be learned directly or later.\n",
      "\n",
      "I think I might have overcomplicated it. Let me try a different approach: for each kanji, decide which word(s) best represent its important reading.\n",
      "\n",
      "- 体: The word 体 itself (からだ) is the most important.\n",
      "- 具: 具体的 (ぐたいてき) shows how 具 is used in compounds with a high score.\n",
      "- 死: 死体 (したい) directly combines 死 and 体, making it essential for understanding 死's usage.\n",
      "- 液: 液体 (えきたい) is fundamental for the kanji 液.\n",
      "\n",
      "The remaining words:\n",
      "\n",
      "- 全体 (ぜんたい): The kanji 全 might be less common on its own. If this word's reading isn't essential, it could go to Not-important.\n",
      "- 体育 (たいいく): The reading here uses たい for 体 but the word itself is a subject area; perhaps not as critical if other sources cover sports terms.\n",
      "- 体重 (たいじゅう): While useful, maybe not as immediately important as others.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, I would categorize:\n",
      "\n",
      "Important: 体、具体的、死体、液体\n",
      "\n",
      "Not-important: 全体、体育、体重\n",

      "But wait, let me double-check. The user's instruction says to respond with the two lists of words, using their exact form. So the output should be:\n",

      "Important: 体 (からだ), 具体的 (ぐたいてき), 死体 (したい), 液体 (えきたい)\n",

The user has provided two words: 乾杯 (かんぱい！, 4) and 一杯 (いっぱい, 4). Both have an importance score of 4, which is pretty high since the scale goes from 0 to 5.\n",

      "First, I need to understand the criteria for categorizing them. The user mentioned that words learned directly after kanji should only be useful ones with important readings. If a word isn't useful or doesn't represent an important reading, it should be learned later. Also, at least one word per kanji should be important to learn the most crucial reading.\n",
      "\n",
      "Looking at 乾杯 (かんぱい！), I know this means \"dry glass\" and is commonly used in Japanese as a toast phrase, like saying \"cheers.\" This usage makes it quite useful and relevant.

      "Next is 一杯 (いっぱい), which means \"one cup\" or \"a drink.\" This is also quite common in daily language when talking about beverages.

The kanji 杯 primarily has this reading as its primary one, so learning this word helps grasp the essential meaning of the kanji.\n",

My task is to determine which ones should be learned immediately after the kanji (important) and which can be learned later.\n",
      "\n",
      "First, I'll go through each word one by one. Starting with 妹 (いもうと, 3). The score here is 3 out of 5, which isn't too low but not super high either. I'm thinking about whether this word represents an important reading for the kanji \"妹.\" Since it's a common term meaning 'sister,' it might be useful to learn early. So maybe it should go in the important list.\n",
      "\n",
      "Next is 電話 (でんわ, 4). The score here is higher at 4, which suggests it's quite important. Plus, \"電話\" means 'telephone,' which is a common word used frequently in daily conversation. It definitely seems like an important word to learn early, so it should be in the important list.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then we have 数 (かず/あく, 3). This kanji has two readings: かず meaning 'number' and あく meaning 'count.' The importance score is 3, but I'm considering whether both readings are essential. Since \"数\" is a basic kanji used in many contexts, learning at least one reading early makes sense. However, the user might prefer to learn more useful words first, so maybe it's better to include it as important.\n",
      "\n",
      "The fourth word is 犬 (いぬ, 2). The score here is lower at 2. \"犬\" means 'dog,' which is a common word but perhaps not as crucial as others. However, since it's a basic animal term and might come up often, I'm leaning towards including it in the important list to ensure the main reading is covered early.\n",
      "\n",
      "Lastly, 一*つ (ひとつ, 4). This has an asterisk, which probably denotes a variant or a specific usage. The score is high at 4, indicating importance. \"一*つ\" can mean 'one' or be used in compound words like 一流 (\"itiritsu,\" meaning first-rate). Given its versatility and the score, it's definitely important to learn early.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, considering all these factors: scores, common usage, and whether they represent key readings for their kanji. All of them have either high importance scores or are fundamental terms. Even though some might be more crucial than others, each contributes significantly to understanding basic vocabulary and readings.\n",
      "\n",
      "Therefore, I think all the provided words should be classified as important because each represents a core reading or is highly useful in daily language use.\n",

      "\n",
      "The user has provided a list of words with their readings and an importance score. The task is to decide which words should be learned immediately after the kanji (important) and which ones can be learned later (not-important). \n",
      "\n",
      "Looking at the words given:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. 意味 (いみ, 5)\n",
      "2. 味 (あじ, 5)\n",
      "3. 味＊わう (あじわう, 2)\n",

      "5. 趣味 (しゅうみ, 4)\n",
      "\n",
      "The importance score is from 0 to 5, so higher numbers are more important.\n",
      "\n",
      "First, I need to consider each kanji and its readings. Each word contains a certain kanji, but sometimes the same kanji appears in multiple words. For example, 味 appears in both 味 (あじ) and 味＊わう (あじわう). \n",
      "\n",
      "The rule is that for less important kanji, it's acceptable to have fewer important words, but at least one word should always be important enough to learn the most important reading of the kanji.\n",
      "\n",
      "Let me break down each kanji:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. 意味: The kanji here is 意 and 味. Wait, no—actually, 意味 is a compound of 意 (mind, intention) and 味 (taste). So each kanji within the word might need consideration.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Perhaps each word is associated with its own specific kanji(s), but in this case, some words share the same kanji. For example, both 味＊わう and 味 use the 味 kanji.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, for each unique kanji, we need to ensure that at least one of its readings is considered important. But I'm not entirely sure how to handle compound kanji like 意味, which might involve multiple individual kanji.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, maybe each word here is treated as a separate entity with their own kanji components. Let me clarify:\n",
      "\n",
      "- 意味: The kanji are 意 and 味.\n",
      "- 味: The kanji is 味.\n",
      "- 味＊わう: Also uses the 味 kanji, plus another part (わう), but the main kanji here is still 味.\n",
      "- 興味: Uses 興 and 味.\n",
      "- 趣味: Uses 趣 and 味.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, for each of these words, their primary kanji might be considered. But perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Maybe the task is to look at each word as a separate entity, regardless of the individual kanji within them.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, no—the user said that all words contain a certain kanji. So each word corresponds to one or more kanji, but for simplicity, maybe we're considering each word as linked to its main kanji.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alternatively, perhaps each word is linked to all the kanji it contains. For example, 意味 includes both 意 and 味 kanji.\n",
      "\n",
      "But given that the user wants to create flashcards for the kanji and words, I think we need to ensure that for each kanji in any of these words, at least one word is important enough to cover its primary reading.\n",
      "\n",
      "This might be getting too complicated. Maybe a simpler approach: for each unique kanji across all words, select at least one word with an importance score high enough (like 5) to cover the main reading.\n",
      "\n",
      "But let's list out all the unique kanji here:\n",
      "\n",
      "- 意\n",
      "- 味\n",
      "- 興\n",
      "- 趣\n",
      "\n",
      "So four unique kanji: 意, 味, 興, 趣.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, for each of these kanji, I need to ensure that at least one word associated with them is important enough (score 5) to cover their primary reading. \n",
      "\n",
      "Looking at the words:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. 意味 (いみ, 5): Contains 意 and 味. Both have high importance scores.\n",
      "2. 味 (あじ, 5): Just 味 with a high score.\n",
      "3. 味＊わう (あじわう, 2): Same kanji 味 but lower score.\n",
      "4. 興味 (きょうみ, 5): Contains 興 and 味. High score.\n",
      "5. 趣味 (しゅうみ, 4): Contains 趣 and 味. Medium-high score.\n",
      "\n",
      "So for each kanji:\n",
      "\n",
      "- 意: Only appears in 意味 with a score of 5. So this word is important to cover 意's main reading.\n",
      "- 味: Appears in multiple words, but the highest score is 5 (味 and 興味). But since 味 itself has a high score, that might be sufficient.\n",
      "- 興: Only appears in 興味 with a score of 5. So this word is important for 舚's main reading.\n",
      "- 趣: Appears in 趣味 with a score of 4. Since there's no higher score for 趣, maybe it's okay to have a 4.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, the task is to decide which words are important (learned immediately) and which are not.\n",
      "\n",
      "The user wants:\n",
      "\n",
      "Important: words that are useful and represent important readings.\n",
      "Not-important: others, especially those with lower scores or less essential readings.\n",
      "\n",
      "Looking at each word's score:\n",
      "\n",
      "- 意味: 5 → Important\n",
      "- 味: 5 → Important\n",
      "- 味＊わう: 2 → Not-important\n",
      "- 舥味: 5 → Important (covers 舚 and 味)\n",
      "- 趣味: 4 → Hmm, this is a bit tricky. Since it's 4, which is still high but not the top.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, but if we mark 趣味 as important, then we cover 趣. If we don't, maybe there are no other words for 趣, so perhaps it needs to be important despite the lower score. But since 4 is a decent score, maybe it's still considered important enough.\n",
      "\n",
      "But looking back at the example response, it was:\n",
      "\n",
      "Important: 意味 味 舥味\n",
      "Not-important: 味＊わう 趣味\n",
      "\n",
      "So in that case, they included all words with scores 5 as important, and the lower ones (2 and 4) as not-important.\n",
      "\n",
      "But wait, 趣味 has a score of 4. Is 4 considered not important enough? Or is it still important because it's medium-high?\n",
      "\n",
      "I think the user wants at least one word per kanji to be important with high scores. So for each kanji (意, 味, 舝, 趣), we need at least one important word.\n",
      "\n",
      "Since 意味 covers 意 and 味, but 舥味 covers 舚 and 味 again. However, 趣 only appears in 趣味 with a 4, so that might be necessary to include as important even though it's not the highest.\n",
      "\n",
      "But the example response didn't include 趣味 in Important. That suggests perhaps they are considering that for kanji like 趣, maybe there are other words elsewhere (but in this list, only 趣味 has 趣). So perhaps including 趣味 as important is necessary to cover its reading.\n",
      "\n",
      "But the example response didn't include it, so maybe the user's intention was to prioritize high scores and exclude lower ones even if that leaves some kanji without coverage. But in reality, for flashcards, you'd need to cover all kanji, so perhaps they made a mistake in the example.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alternatively, maybe the user considers 4 as not important enough, but I'm not sure.\n",
      "\n",
      "In any case, following the example response:\n",
      "\n",
      "Important: 意味 味 舥味\n",
      "Not-important: 味＊わう 趣味\n",
      "\n",
      "So that's two high-score words for 味 (味 and 舥味), one each for 意 and 舻. But then, 趣 is left without an important word.\n",
      "\n",
      "But perhaps the user assumes that other resources will cover those kanji, or maybe it's a mistake in the example.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alternatively, if we have to follow strictly based on scores, then any word with score 5 goes into Important, others into Not-important. So:\n",
      "\n",
      "Important: 意味 (5), 味 (5), 舥味 (5)\n",
      "Not-important: 味＊わう (2), 趣味 (4)\n",
      "\n",
      "But this leaves 趣 without coverage. So perhaps the user's example is just a sample and doesn't cover all cases.\n",
      "\n",

The user has provided five words with their readings and importance scores. Each word contains a specific kanji, and my job is to decide which ones should be learned directly after the kanji (Important) and which ones can be learned later (Not-important). \n",
      "\n",
      "Let me look at each word one by one. The first word is 来年 (らいねん, 5). It has an importance score of 5, which is the highest. This word means \"next year.\" Since it's a high score, I should probably include it in the Important list. It’s also a common word that represents an important reading for the kanji 来.\n",
      "\n",
      "Next is 出来る (できる, 5). Again, another high score of 5. This word means \"can do\" and is very commonly used. The kanji here are 出 and 來, but together they form a useful verb. It's definitely essential to learn this early.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then we have 以来 (いらい, 3). The importance score is 3, which isn't as high but still moderate. This word means \"since\" or \"from then on.\" It’s useful in certain contexts, especially in formal writing. However, it might not be the most immediately necessary word compared to others with higher scores.\n",
      "\n",
      "The fourth word is 将来 (しょうらい, 3). Another score of 3, meaning \"future.\" This is a significant concept in language and is used often in various contexts, so it should be considered important as well. It's one of the main readings for the kanji 将.\n",
      "\n",
      "Lastly, 来＊る (くる, 5). The asterisk here probably represents a placeholder, but regardless, the reading is \"kur\" and the score is high at 5. This word means \"come,\" which is fundamental in Japanese. It’s an essential verb that's used frequently, so it definitely belongs in the Important list.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, I need to decide which ones go into Important and Not-important. All have some importance, but based on scores, 来年 (らいねん), 出来る (できる), and 来＊る (くる) are all at 5, making them crucial. 将来 (しょうらい) is at 3 but still important enough for the initial learning. \n",
      "\n",
      "However, since each kanji should have at least one word that represents an important reading, I might need to ensure coverage across all provided words. But looking back, the user specified that only the most useful and readings should be in Important initially. So, considering their scores, 来年 (らいねん), 出来る (できる), 将来 (しょうらい), and 来＊る (くる) are all important, while 以来 (いらい) might be better suited for later learning.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, but the user also mentioned that \"All words may be classified as important.\" So maybe I should only include those with higher scores or more essential meanings in Important. Given that, I'll place 来年, 出来る, 将来, and 来＊る in Important because they have high scores (5) and are very useful. 以来, with a score of 3, might be less urgent but still somewhat important.\n",

      "Okay, I'm trying to figure out how to sort these Japanese words into important and not-important categories based on their readings and importance scores. The user has provided a list of words with their kanji, readings, and an importance score from 0 to 5. My task is to determine which words should be learned directly after the kanji (important) and which ones can be learned later (not-important).\n",
      "\n",
      "First, I need to understand the criteria clearly. The important words are those that are useful and represent important readings of the kanji. If a word isn't useful or doesn't showcase an important reading, it goes into not-important. Also, for less important kanji, having fewer important words is acceptable, but at least one important word should be present to cover the most crucial reading.\n",
      "\n",
      "Looking at the given example:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. 英雄 (えいゆう, 0)\n",
      "\n",
      "The importance score here is 0, which I assume is on a scale where higher numbers are more important. Since it's 0, this word might not be as critical. The kanji in question is 英雄, which means \"hero.\" However, the reading is えいゆう.\n",
      "\n",
      "I need to decide if 英雄 is an essential word for learning this kanji. Given that the importance score is low (0), it suggests that this word isn't very important. Therefore, it might be better suited to be learned later rather than immediately after the kanji. \n",
      "\n",
      "But wait, the instructions say that at least one word should always be important to cover the most crucial reading. However, in this case, maybe there's another word with a higher importance score associated with the same kanji. But since only 英雄 is provided, I have to consider it as the main word.\n",
      "\n",
      "In this scenario, even though the importance score is low, it might still be necessary to include it in the important list because it's the primary word for that kanji's reading. Alternatively, if there are other words with higher scores linked to the same kanji, those should be prioritized, but here we only have one.\n",

      "\n",
      "First, I need to understand the criteria for classification. The important words are those that are useful and represent important readings of their kanji. If a word isn't useful or doesn't show an important reading, it should be placed in the not-important category. Also, each kanji should ideally have at least one important word to cover its main reading.\n",
      "\n",
      "Looking at 全然 (ぜんぜん), the kanji is 全, which means \"all\" or \"complete.\" The reading ぜんぜん is a common way to express \"completely,\" so this seems important. It's also got a high importance score of 4, so that supports it being important.\n",
      "\n",
      "Next, 自然 (しぜん) uses the kanji 自 and 然. 自 means \"self\" or \"own,\" and 然 can mean \"so\" or \"thus.\" The word 自然 means \"nature\" or \"natural,\" which is a fundamental concept in Japanese. It also has an importance score of 4, so it should be considered important.\n",
      "\n",
      "Finally, 当然 (とうぜん) uses the kanji 当 and 然. 当 can mean \"when\" or \"concerning,\" and 然 again means \"so\" or \"thus.\" The word itself translates to \"of course\" or \"naturally.\" Its importance score is 3, which is still quite high but a bit lower than the others. However, it's still a very common and useful word.\n",
      "\n",
      "Since all three words have high importance scores and represent key readings of their kanji, they should all be classified as important.

      "### Key Considerations:\n",
      "1. **Kanji Focus**: The kanji in question is 燁, which relates to meanings like \"burn\" or \"combustion.\"\n",

      "### Analysis:\n",
      "- **_IMPORTANT Words_** (Score ≥ 4):\n",
      "  - 燸＊やす: Directly relates to the kanji's meaning, useful for understanding its core usage.\n",
      "  - 燪＊える: A central verb meaning \"to burn,\" crucial for grasping the kanji's primary function.\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Not-important Words_** (Score ≤ 2):\n",
      "  - 燪＊える (score 2): While related, it may be less emphasized due to its lower score.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Conclusion:\n",
      "The words are categorized as follows:\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Important**: 燸＊やす, 燪＊える\n",
      "- **Not-important**: 燪＊える\n",
      "\n",
      "This categorization prioritizes words directly tied to the kanji's core meanings and readings.\n",
      "Error processing answer: The answer must contain exactly two lines (after removing any <think> section): one starting with 'Important:' and one with 'Not-important:'.\n",
      "<think>\n",
      "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how to sort these Japanese words into important and not-important categories based on their readings and importance scores. The user provided a list with four entries, all containing the kanji 燃.\n",
      "\n",
      "First, let me look at each word:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **燃＊やす**: Reading is もやす, importance score 4.\n",
      "2. **不燃ゴミ**: Reading is ふねんごみ, score 3.\n",
      "3. **燃＊える**: Reading is もえる, score 4.\n",
      "4. **燃＊える**: Same reading and kanji but different score? Wait, no—the third and fourth entries have the same kanji and reading, but different scores: 4 and 2 respectively.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, that's a bit confusing because two entries have the exact same word but different scores. That might be a mistake or perhaps they're intended to be separate. I'll treat them as separate entries for now.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, I need to decide which words are important enough to be learned directly after the kanji and which should be saved for later.\n",
      "\n",
      "The rule is that if a word is useful and represents an important reading, it should be classified as important. Otherwise, it's not-important. Also, each kanji must have at least one important word to learn its most important reading.\n",
      "\n",
      "Looking at 燃 (mo), the main readings are まする (maseru) for \"to burn\" and もうす (mousu) which I think is less common. The provided words are:\n",
      "\n",
      "- 燧＊やす: かもやす, but in this case, it's written as 燃＊やす, so the reading is also かもやす? Wait no—the user wrote it as 燃＊やす with the reading もやす, which seems incorrect because 燩asu is usually かもasu or something else. Maybe I'm getting confused here.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, let me clarify:\n",
      "\n",
      "- The first word: 燃＊やす (もやす). So the kanji is 燧 and the reading is 也asu? Or maybe it's 燈 plus also... Wait no, 燧 is usually read as mo or かも. Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, no—the user provided the readings as 4 for 燵＊やす (もやす), which seems like a possible way to write it, but maybe it's more about how the kanji is used in compounds.\n",
      "\n",
      "But let me think about each word:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **燃＊やす**: Reading 也asu (mo yasu?), score 4.\n",
      "2. **不燃ゴミ**: Not 燧 but 不燃, which combines 燧 and じょう or another character? Wait no—the word is 不燃ゴミ, which is \"non-combustible garbage.\" The reading is ふねんごみ. So the kanji here are 不、燃、ゴミ. But since we're focusing on 燷, this might not be directly relevant unless it's part of a compound with 燧.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, but the user said all words contain a certain kanji, so each word must include 燁 (I think that's the correct character here; maybe 燩). So perhaps:\n",
      "\n",
      "- 燧＊やす: This would be 燈 plus 也asu? Or maybe it's 燃 (mo) + やす. I'm not sure about this one.\n",
      "\n",
      "But given the importance score of 4, which is quite high, this word might be considered important.\n",
      "\n",
      "Next, **不燃ゴミ**: The kanji here are 不、燃、ゴミ. Since we're focusing on 燻, perhaps this isn't a direct example for learning 燁's readings but rather part of a compound. However, the importance score is 3, which is still high but not as high as 4.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then we have two entries with **燃＊える**: both with reading もえる, scores 4 and 2. So one has a higher score than the other. The reading moeru means \"to burn\" or \"catch fire.\" This seems like a core meaning of 燁, so it's important.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, but why are there two entries for the same word? Maybe they're different usages or contexts, but since both have the kanji 燧 and the reading える, I think only one is needed. But perhaps the scores indicate that one is more important than the other.\n",
      "\n",
      "So now, considering which words represent important readings of the kanji 燁:\n",
      "\n",
      "- 燸＊やす (もやす): Score 4. If this is a common word, it's important. Maybe it means \"ashes\" or something similar.\n",
      "- 不燃ゴミ: Score 3. This might be more about knowing that 燁 can form compounds like 不燃 (burnable vs non-burnable), but perhaps it's less directly tied to the basic reading of 燁.\n",
      "- 燪＊える: Score 4 and 2. Since this is a core verb meaning \"to burn,\" it's crucial.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, for the important list, I should include:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. 燸＊やす (also known as かもasu or something else? Wait, perhaps it's かまdochira? No, maybe not. Alternatively, it could be かも燃える? I'm getting a bit confused here.)\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating the actual meanings. The user provided the readings and scores. So regardless of my confusion about the actual words, based on scores:\n",
      "\n",
      "- 燸＊やす (4) is important.\n",
      "- 不燃ゴミ (3): Maybe not as directly tied to the kanji's main reading but still useful in compounds.\n",
      "- 燪＊える (4): Definitely important because it's a core verb.\n",
      "\n",
      "But since each kanji needs at least one important word, and these all share 燁, perhaps we should prioritize the words that represent the most common readings. Since 燪＊える is more central to 燁's meaning, maybe only that should be in important, but considering both have high scores.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, but two entries have the same kanji and reading? That might not make sense. Maybe it's a typo or duplication. Alternatively, perhaps they are different words with the same kanji and reading but different meanings.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alternatively, perhaps 燪＊える (4) is more important than the one with score 2.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, in that case:\n",
      "\n",
      "Important: 燸＊やす, 燪＊える\n",
      "\n",
      "Not-important: 不燃ゴミ, 燪＊える (the one with score 2)\n",
      "\n",
      "But since both 燪＊える have the same kanji and reading but different scores, maybe only the higher score is important.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alternatively, perhaps it's better to include all high-score words as important. But I'm not sure if 燸＊やす is a real word or just an example here.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, looking at the format, the user wants the words to be classified based on whether they are learned directly after the kanji. So for each kanji, we need to pick the most important readings.\n",
      "\n",
      "Given that, I think 燪＊える (moeru) is a fundamental reading, so it's definitely important. The other one with 2 might not be as crucial.\n",
      "\n",
      "As for 燸＊やす, if it's a common word, perhaps it should be included too. But if it's less common, maybe not. Since the score is 4, which is high, I think it's better to include it.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, the user mentioned that some words are learned directly after the kanji if they're useful and represent important readings. So 燪＊える (also written as 燒＊える) with a higher score should be included in important, while the one with lower score goes to not-important.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, but the two entries for 燪＊える have different scores. How does that work? Maybe only the first one is considered important, and the second is less so.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alternatively, perhaps both are different usages of the same kanji with the same reading but different contexts.\n",
      "\n",
      "This is getting a bit confusing, but I think it's best to prioritize the higher score for 燪＊える as important and include 燸＊やす as well. So:\n",
      "\n",
      "Important: 燸＊やす, 燪＊える (score 4)\n",
      "\n",
      "Not-important: 不燃ゴミ, 燪＊える (score 2)\n",
      "\n",
      "But I'm not entirely sure if both of the same word with different scores should be included. Maybe just one instance is enough.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alternatively, since all three have scores above 2 except one, maybe they're all important, but that seems unlikely.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, perhaps the user expects to include words with high scores as important and lower ones as not. So:\n",
      "\n",
      "Important: 燸＊やす (4), 燪＊える (4)\n",
      "\n",
      "Not-important: 不燃ゴミ (3) [maybe still considered important?], 燪＊える (2) [definitely less important]\n",
      "\n",
      "But I think the key is to select the most important words that directly tie to the kanji's core readings. Since 燪＊える is a central verb, it should definitely be included.\n",
      "\n",
      "As for 燸＊やす, if it's a common noun related to burning or fire, perhaps it's also important. But without knowing exactly what it means, I can't say for sure. However, given the score of 4, I think it's safer to include it in important.\n",
      "\n",
      "So my final decision is:\n",
      "\n",
      "Important: 燸＊やす, 燪＊える\n",
      "\n",
      "Not-important: 不燃ゴミ, 燪＊える (score 2)\n",
      "\n",
      "But wait, that leaves two entries in not-important which might be too many. Maybe only one word is considered not important, but the user didn't specify how many.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alternatively, perhaps only the words with scores below a certain threshold go to not-important. Since 3 and 2 are lower than 4, maybe they are included as not-important.\n",
      "\n",
      "But this is getting speculative. I think the safest approach is:\n",
      "\n",
      "Important: 燸＊やす (score 4), 燪＊える (score 4)\n",
      "\n",
      "Not-important: 不燃ゴミ (score 3), 燪＊える (score 2)\n",
      "\n",
      "But perhaps it's better to only include the highest scores in important. Alternatively, if a word is part of a compound, like 不燃戈美, maybe it's still useful even if not directly tied to the kanji's main reading.\n",
      "\n",
      "In any case, I think the answer should reflect that 燪＊える (score 4) and 燸＊やす (score 4) are important, while the others with lower scores are not. However, since 不燃戈美 has a score of 3, which is still decent, maybe it's better to include it as important.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, but the user said \"I am going to give you a list of words, each containing a certain kanji.\" So perhaps for each kanji (which is 燁), we have multiple words. Therefore, we need to select the most important ones that help in learning the kanji.\n",
      "\n",
      "So focusing on 燁, which words best represent its readings and meanings? The two with score 4 are:\n",
      "\n",
      "- 燸＊やす: If this word is related to 燁's meaning (e.g., ashes or something), it's useful.\n",
      "- 燪＊える: A core verb meaning \"to burn.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The other two are:\n",
      "\n",
      "- 不燃戈美: Which involves 燁 in a compound, perhaps indicating non-combustibility.\n",
      "- 燪＊える (lower score): Still the same verb but maybe less emphasized.\n",
      "\n",
      "So considering that, I think both 燸＊やす and 燪＊える should be included as important because they directly tie to the kanji's readings. The other two might still be useful but perhaps not essential for basic understanding.\n",
      "\n",
      "But since 不燃戈美 has a score of 3, which is higher than 2, maybe it's also important. However, it's part of a compound and may be more advanced.\n",
      "\n",
      "Given that, I think the best approach is to include all words with scores above 2 in important. So:\n",
      "\n",
      "Important: 燸＊やす (4), 燪＊える (4), 不燃戈美 (3)\n",
      "\n",
      "Not-important: 燪＊える (2)\n",
      "\n",
      "But this depends on whether a score of 3 is considered important. If the cutoff is, say, above 3, then only the ones with 4 are included.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alternatively, perhaps all words except the lowest should be considered important.\n",

      "- 金玉: 3\n",

      "The user mentioned that the score ranges from 0 to 5, but they can use their own judgment. So I need to decide which words represent important readings for each kanji.\n",
      "\n",
      "Starting with 玉:\n",
      "- The main reading for 玉 is 'たま', which appears in 玉子 (たまご), 目玉 (めだま), and 金玉 (きんたま). Since all these use the same reading, but their importance scores are 2,3, and 3 respectively.\n",
      "- To cover the most important reading, I should include at least one word with 'たま'. The highest score here is 玉 itself with a 3. So including 玉 makes sense as it directly teaches the kanji's main reading.\n",
      "\n",
      "Next, 目玉:\n",
      "- This contains 目 and 玉. Since we've already included 玉 for its important reading, 目玉 can be considered later unless it's essential. Its importance score is 2, which is lower than others.\n",
      "\n",
      "For 金玉:\n",
      "- Similarly, this uses 金 and 玉. We have 玉 covered, so 金玉 might not be necessary immediately. Its score is also 3, same as 玉, but since 玉 itself is a standalone kanji, perhaps it's better to prioritize that.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, the Important list should include 玉 (3) and 玉子 (2), as both are important for the reading 'たま' and have decent scores. Wait, but according to the user's example response, they only included 玉 in Important. Maybe I should follow that logic—only include the kanji itself if it's a standalone word with an important score.\n",
      "\n",
      "But wait, the user wants words, not just kanji. So when a word contains a kanji and its reading is important, it should be included as Important. However, the example response only listed the kanji names, which might have confused me earlier.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait no, looking back: The user's instruction says to respond with the word exactly as given. So if the word includes multiple kanji, but we're considering each kanji individually, perhaps I should check for each kanji separately.\n",
      "\n",
      "Let me clarify:\n",
      "\n",
      "Each word contains certain kanji. For each kanji in a word, if that word is the primary way to learn that kanji's important reading, then it should be marked as Important.\n",
      "\n",
      "Looking at 玉子 (たまご), it teaches 玉 and 子. The main reading for 玉 is 'たま', which is also used in other words like 目玉 and 金玉. However, since 玉 itself has a higher score (3), perhaps including 玉 alone is sufficient to cover the important reading.\n",
      "\n",
      "But the user's example response included only the standalone kanji as Important. So maybe the rule is that if a word is directly learned after the kanji, it should be the kanji itself with its most common reading. Then, compound words can come later.\n",
      "\n",
      "In that case:\n",
      "\n",
      "- 玉 (たま) is a standalone kanji and has an importance score of 3, so it's important.\n",
      "- 目玉 and 金玉 are compounds; their individual kanjis (目 and 金) might not be standalone in this list. Wait, no— the words given include all four, but perhaps only 玉 is a standalone kanji here.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, looking at the words:\n",
      "\n",
      "- 玉子 includes 玉 and 子.\n",
      "- 玉 is a standalone word.\n",
      "- 目玉 includes 目 and 玉.\n",
      "- 金玉 includes 金 and 玉.\n",
      "\n",
      "So for each kanji present in these words, we need to decide if any word teaches it in an important way. Since 玉 is a standalone word with the highest importance (3), that should be marked as Important.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, the other words:\n",
      "\n",
      "- 玉子: since it's a compound and its score is 2, perhaps it's not as critical as learning 玉 first.\n",
      "- 目玉 and 金玉 are both compounds. They might be better learned later once the individual kanjis are known.\n",
      "\n",
      "But wait, does each word need to have at least one important word per kanji? The user said that for less important kanji, it's acceptable to have less important words, but at least one word should always be important to cover the most crucial reading.\n",
      "\n",
      "In this case:\n",
      "\n",
      "- 玉 is covered by its standalone word (玉), which is important.\n",
      "- 目 appears in 目玉. Since there's no standalone 目 in the list, perhaps 目玉 is needed to learn 目's reading. But since it's a compound with a lower score, maybe not immediately.\n",
      "- 金 similarly appears only in 金玉, so that might be necessary as well.\n",
      "\n",
      "But according to the user's example response, they didn't include all compounds, just selected those directly tied to important readings.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, in their example, for similar words like 目 and 金, perhaps they would prioritize their standalone forms if they existed. But since these are not provided, maybe only 玉 is considered Important as a standalone word.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, the final decision:\n",
      "\n",
      "Important: 玉 (3) because it's a standalone kanji with an important score.\n",
      "\n",
      "Not-important: 玉子, 目玉, 金玉, because they can be learned later once the base readings are covered. However, since the user's example included only one word in Important and others in Not-important, perhaps I should follow that structure.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, but the user provided four words, so the response should list all four, split into two groups.\n",
      "\n",
      "In their example, 一*つ was considered important, so maybe any word with a score above a certain threshold (like 3 or higher) is Important. Let's see:\n",
      "\n",
      "- 玉: 3\n",
      "- 金玉: 3\n",
      "\n",
      "So both have scores of 3. Perhaps those are Important.\n",
      "\n",
      "But in the initial response, only 玉 was included as Important, and others as Not-important. Maybe it's based on whether the word is a standalone kanji or not.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alternatively, maybe any word with an important score (like ≥2) is considered Important, but the user seems to have their own criteria beyond just scores.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, looking at the example given by the user: 一番 was given and deemed important. So perhaps it's based on whether the word is a standalone kanji or if its reading is crucial for that kanji.\n",
      "\n",
      "In our case:\n",
      "\n",
      "- 玉 (3) is Important.\n",
      "- 目玉 and 金玉 are compounds with lower scores, so Not-important.\n",
      "- 玉子 also has a score of 2; perhaps it's Not-important as well.\n",
      "\n",
      "But the user's example included only one word in Important. So I think the conclusion is:\n",
      "\n",
      "Important: 玉\n",
      "\n",
      "Not-important: 玉子, 目玉, 金玉\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, but there are four words to categorize, so two groups with all four split between them. Since the example had a group of one and three, perhaps that's the structure.\n",
      "\n",
      "But I'm a bit confused now. Let me re-examine the user's instruction:\n",
      "\n",
      "They provided an example where they listed only the Important ones as 玉, and others in Not-important. So maybe each word needs to be evaluated individually based on whether it's crucial for learning its kanji(s).\n",
      "\n",
      "Since 玉 is a standalone kanji with an important score (3), it's Important.\n",
      "\n",
      "The other words are compounds that might not need immediate attention unless their individual kanjis aren't covered elsewhere.\n",
      "\n",
      "But since 目 and 金 are only in these compound words, perhaps those should also be considered Not-important. But without standalone forms, maybe they can't be learned otherwise, so perhaps all except 玉 are Not-important.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alternatively, if the user's example includes 玉 as Important and others as Not, then that's the pattern to follow.\n",
      "\n",

If a word isn't useful or doesn't show an important reading, it should be learned later. Also, each kanji group should have at least one important word to learn the most important reading.\n",

      "Each of these words contains the kanji \"国.\" I need to assess each one's importance based on their score and how they help in understanding the readings of \"国.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Starting with 国 itself. It has a high importance score of 5, which suggests it's very important. Since it directly uses the kanji \"国\" and is standalone, learning this word immediately would be crucial for knowing the basic reading \"くに.\" So, this should definitely go in the Important list.\n",
      "\n",
      "Next is 国民 (こくみん) with a score of 3. This word uses \"国,\" but it's read as \"こく,\" which is another important reading of the kanji. Since it has a decent importance score and teaches an alternative reading, it makes sense to include it in the Important list.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then we have 全国 (ぜんこく), scored at 2. This uses \"国\" again but with the reading \"こく.\" However, its importance score is lower than the others. It might still be useful, but maybe not as essential as higher-scored words. But considering it teaches another reading, I'm leaning towards including it in Important.\n",
      "\n",
      "中国 (ちゅうごく) has a score of 4. This word uses \"国\" and is read as \"ごく,\" which is another important reading. Given the high score, this should definitely be in the Important list because it's a common word and reinforces different readings.\n",
      "\n",
      "国際的 (こくさいてき) scores at 3. It also uses \"国\" with the reading \"こく.\" The word itself is more advanced but still useful for understanding compounds and additional readings. Including it might be beneficial, so I think it should go in Important.\n",
      "\n",
      "Lastly, 天国 (てんごく) has a score of 3. This reads as \"こく,\" which overlaps with the same reading as 国民 and 中国. While it's a useful word, its score is lower than others, but since it uses an important reading, I think it should still be included in Important.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, but all these words are using \"国\" in different readings. The highest score is 5 for 国 itself, so that must be the primary one to include. Then, other high-scored ones like 中国 (4) and 国民 (3), followed by 国際的 (3). 全国 at 2 might still be useful but perhaps not as crucial. 天国 is also 3.\n",
      "\n",
      "But since all are using \"国\" with different readings, maybe it's better to include them all in Important because they each teach a different reading of the kanji. However, considering their scores, maybe the lower ones like 全国 (2) can be placed later if needed, but I'm not sure if that's necessary.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, the user said some should be learned immediately and others later, depending on their utility and importance for readings. So perhaps words that are more essential or higher scoring should be in Important, while lower ones go to Not-important.\n",
      "\n",
      "So 国 (5) is definitely important. 中国 (4), 国民 (3), 国際的 (3), 天国 (3) – all have scores above 2, so they should probably be included in Important. 全国 has a score of 2, which might make it less critical but still useful. However, since the user wants at least one important word per kanji group to learn the main reading, and 国 is already covered by itself, perhaps including only the most essential ones.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, but all these words are part of the same kanji group (\"国\"), so I think it's better to include as many as possible in Important because each teaches different readings or usages. So maybe all should be in Important except possibly one with the lowest score.\n",
      "\n",
      "But the user's example response only included certain ones, suggesting that not all might be considered important. However, without specific instructions on how to prioritize beyond scores, it's a bit unclear. I think the safest approach is to include words with higher scores and those that teach primary readings in Important, while others go later.\n",
      "\n",
      "So considering this, I'll list 国 (5), 中国 (4), 国民 (3), 国際的 (3), and 天国 (3) as Important. 全国 (2) might be less critical but still useful, so perhaps it's better to include it too, especially since it teaches another reading.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, maybe the user expects that all words should be in Important because they each contribute to understanding different readings of \"国.\" Therefore, I'll list all as Important except none, given their scores are 2 and above. So all go into Important.\n",

      "\n",
      "First, I need to understand the criteria for sorting them. The key points are:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Words that directly follow a kanji should be useful and represent important readings.\n",
      "2. If a word isn't useful or doesn't show an important reading, it should be learned later.\n",
      "3. Even if all words might seem important, less important kanji can have less important words. However, at least one word must be important to cover the most crucial reading.\n",
      "\n",
      "Looking at 梅酒 (うめしゅ) and 梨梅 (うめ). \n",
      "\n",
      "- 梅酒: This is a compound of 梅 (plum) and 酒 (sake), making plum wine. It's quite common in Japanese culture, so it seems useful.\n",
      "- 梨梅: I'm not as familiar with this one. It might be a less common term or perhaps a regional dialect. Without knowing its usage frequency, it's hard to say if it's important.\n",
      "\n",
      "The importance scores are 1 for 梅酒 and 3 for 梅. Since higher numbers indicate more importance, I should prioritize the word with the higher score first. 梨梅 (うめ) has a higher score, but wait, that might be confusing because 梨梅 isn't listed in the examples given by the user.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, no—the user only provided two words: 梅酒 and 梅. The second one is written as 梅 (うめ). So perhaps there's confusion here because both are 梅, but different readings? Or maybe I misread the initial data.\n",
      "\n",
      "Let me clarify. The user wrote:\n",
      "\n",
      "The words are: 梅酒 (うめしゅ, 1), 梅 (うめ, 3)\n",
      "\n",
      "So, 梅酒 is a word with reading \"ume shu\" and importance score 1, while 梨梅 is not provided; instead, another entry for 梅 (梅) with reading \"ume\" and score 3. \n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, no—looking back, the user wrote:\n",
      "\n",
      "The words are: 梅酒 (うめしゅ, 1), 梅 (うめ, 3)\n",
      "\n",
      "So it's two separate entries: one is 梅酒, the other is 梅.\n",
      "\n",
      "So for each kanji or word, we have to decide if a word should be learned immediately after the kanji. The important words are those that teach an important reading of the kanji and are useful.\n",
      "\n",
      "Given that, I think 梅酒 uses the kanji 梅 (ume) and 酒 (sake). But wait, no: 梨梅 is another word. Wait, no—no, in this case, the user provided two words: 梅酒 and 梅.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, perhaps each of these is a separate entry. Let's parse them:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. 梅酒: The kanji are 梅 (ume) and 酒 (sake). So it's a compound word for plum wine.\n",
      "2. 梨梅: Wait, no, the second word is just 梅 with reading うめ and importance score 3.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me list out each word:\n",
      "\n",
      "- Word 1: 梅酒 (うめしゅ, 1)\n",
      "- Word 2: 梅 (うめ, 3)\n",
      "\n",
      "Each of these is a separate entry. Now, we need to decide which ones should be learned immediately after the kanji and which can be delayed.\n",
      "\n",
      "For each kanji, at least one word must be important to learn its primary reading. So for 梅酒, the kanji involved are 梅 and 酒.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, but actually, in this case, the user is providing words that contain a certain kanji. Each word has its own kanji(s), but I'm not entirely sure how they're being used here. The initial instruction says all words contain a certain kanji.\n",
      "\n",
      "So perhaps each word's kanji needs to be considered separately. But given the user's message, it's unclear if we're supposed to consider each word as a separate kanji or part of the same set.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, maybe I should think about this differently. The task is to sort the words into important and not-important based on whether they represent an important reading of their kanji.\n",
      "\n",
      "Given that:\n",
      "\n",
      "- 梅酒 (うめしゅ) has an importance score of 1.\n",
      "- 梨梅 (うめ) has a higher score, 3.\n",
      "\n",
      "But wait, in the user's message, it's written as \"The words are: 梅酒 (うめしゅ, 1), 梨梅 (うめ, 3)\". Wait no, looking back, the user wrote:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"The words are: 梅酒 (うめしゅ, 1), 梅 (うめ, 3)\"\n",

      "So the second word is just 梅, not 梨梅. So that's a bit confusing because both have the same kanji.\n",

      "- 梅酒 (ume shu) with score 1\n",
      "- 梨梅 (ume) with score 3\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, but 梨梅 is more likely a dialect or less common term. So perhaps the higher importance score of 3 is for a less useful word.\n",
      "\n",
      "So according to the criteria:\n",
      "\n",
      "Words that directly follow the kanji and are important should be learned first. Words that aren't as useful or don't represent an important reading should be learned later.\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "Wait, no—the scores are given by the user, so perhaps higher scores mean more importance. So the word with 3 should be important, and 1 not as much.\n",
      "\n",
      "But the problem is that for each kanji, at least one word must be important to cover the primary reading. But in this case, both words have different kanji: 梅酒 uses 梅 and 酒; 梨梅 uses 梨 and 梅.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait no, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Let me try again.\n",
      "\n",
      "Each word has a certain kanji(s). The user wants to sort the provided words into important and not-important based on whether they should be learned directly after the kanji or later.\n",

      "\n",
      "Wait no, perhaps it's better to just go by the exact information given.\n",
      "\n",
      "Assuming that the user provided two words:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. 梐酒 (うめしゅ) with score 1\n",
      "2. 梕梅 (うめ) with score 3\n",
      "\n",
      "But I think this might be a mistake because 梕梅 is not a standard word, and perhaps he meant 梅.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alternatively, perhaps the user provided:\n",
      "\n",
      "- 梐酒: plum wine, score 1\n",
      "- 梒梅: perhaps a less common term, but it's unclear. Alternatively, maybe it's 梨梅, which refers to Japanese apricot or something else.\n",
      "\n",
      "Given that, perhaps I should treat them as two separate words with their own kanji.\n",
      "\n",
      "But regardless, the task is to sort these into important and not-important based on whether they represent an important reading for their respective kanji.\n",
      "\n",
      "So:\n",
      "\n",
      "- For 梐酒 (うめしゅ), the kanji are 梐 and 酒. The word's importance score is 1.\n",
      "- For 梕梅 (うめ), the kanji are 梕 and 梅, with a higher score of 3.\n",
      "\n",
      "But perhaps I'm overcomplicating it again. Maybe each word is associated with one kanji:\n",
      "\n",
      "For example:\n",
      "\n",
      "- 梐酒 is associated with 梐\n",
      "- 梓梅 is associated with 梓\n",
      "\n",
      "But without knowing the exact association, it's hard to decide.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alternatively, maybe each word has multiple kanji, and we need to assign based on their importance for each kanji.\n",
      "\n",
      "This is getting too confusing. Perhaps I should proceed by considering that higher scores indicate more important words, so 梕梅 (3) should be in the important list, while 梐酒 (1) might not be as crucial but still could be important depending on usage.\n",
      "\n",
      "But given that the user wants to sort them into two lists, I'll assume:\n",
      "\n",
      "Important: 梕梅 (score 3)\n",
      "Not Important: 梐酒 (score 1)\n",
      "\n",
      "Alternatively, considering that 梐酒 is a more common compound and has practical use, maybe it should be important despite the lower score.\n",

      "\n",
      "First, looking at the list provided:\n",
      "\n",
      "- 中級 (ちゅうきゅう, 3)\n",
      "- 中 (ちゅう, 2)\n",
      "- 中 (なか, 5)\n",
      "- 中学校 (ちゅうがっこう, 3)\n",
      "- 真ん中 (まんなか, 3)\n",
      "- 世の中 (よのなか, 4)\n",
      "\n",
      "Each word has a kanji, reading(s), and an importance score from 0 to 5. The task is to determine which words should be learned immediately after the kanji (Important) and which can be deferred (Not-important).\n",
      "\n",
      "The key points are:\n",
      "1. Words learned directly after the kanji should only be those that are useful and represent important readings.\n",
      "2. At least one word per kanji should be important to learn the most important reading.\n",
      "\n",
      "I need to analyze each kanji's primary reading and see if any of its words are essential or high-value.\n",
      "\n",
      "Starting with the kanji 中 (ちゅう, 2) and 中 (なか, 5). The same kanji can have multiple readings. For 中, the readings are ちゅう and なか, with importance scores 2 and 5 respectively. Since 5 is higher, なか is more important for this kanji.\n",
      "\n",
      "Next, looking at 中級 (ちゅうきゅう, 3) which uses 中 as part of a compound word. The reading ちゅう here contributes to the meaning 'intermediate' or 'advanced level.' The importance score is 3, so it's moderately important but not top priority.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then there's 中学校 (ちゅうがっこう, 3), another compound using 中 with the reading ちゅう. It means 'middle school,' which is a common term in education systems, making it useful, though the importance score is 3.\n",
      "\n",
      "真ん中 (まんなか, 3) uses a different kanji but also has the reading なか, contributing to the meaning 'center' or 'midst.' The importance score is 3 here as well.\n",
      "\n",
      "Lastly, 世の中 (よのなか, 4) combines two kanjis: 世 and 中. Both have their readings, with 中 being なか again. This phrase means 'the world' or 'society,' which is quite important contextually, hence the higher importance score of 4.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, considering that each kanji should have at least one important word to learn its primary reading:\n",
      "\n",
      "- For 中 (ちゅう), the word 中学校 (ちゅうがっこう) uses ちゅう and has a score of 3. However, 中 itself is read as なか with a higher score (5). So maybe 中 (なか) should be considered important for that reading.\n",
      "- The word 中級 (ちゅうきゅう) uses the same ちゅう reading but with a lower importance score compared to 中 (なか).\n",
      "- 真ん中 and 世の中 both use the なか reading, which is high priority. However, since they are compound words, maybe only one of them needs to be selected as important.\n",
      "\n",
      "Given that, I think:\n",
      "\n",
      "Important should include:\n",
      "- 中 (なか) because it's a core word with a high importance score.\n",
      "- 真ん中 or 世の中. Since 世の中 has a higher score (4), it might take precedence over 真ん中 (3). But both are useful.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, but the user wants to split them into Important and Not-important. So perhaps pick the highest-value words for Important.\n",
      "\n",
      "Looking again:\n",
      "\n",
      "- 中 (なか) is essential because it's a standalone word with high usage.\n",
      "- 世の中 is also highly important as it combines two kanjis and has a score of 4, which is quite significant.\n",
      "- 中学校 is moderately important but might be better learned later if we prioritize higher-value words.\n",
      "\n",
      "So perhaps Important includes 中 (なか), 真ん中, and 世の中. But wait, let me check the scores again.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait no: The importance scores are per word, not per kanji reading. So each word's score is based on its own value.\n",
      "\n",
      "Let me list all words with their scores:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. 中級 (3)\n",
      "2. 中 (ちゅう) - 2\n",
      "3. 中 (なか) -5\n",
      "4. 中学校 (3)\n",
      "5. 真ん中 (3)\n",
      "6. 世の中 (4)\n",
      "\n",
      "So the highest score is 中 (なか) at 5, then 世の中 at 4, followed by others.\n",
      "\n",
      "I think the strategy should be to prioritize words with higher scores first for Important, as they represent more important readings or are more useful.\n",
      "\n",
      "Therefore:\n",
      "\n",
      "Important:\n",
      "- 中 (なか) because it's a core word with high usage and a high score.\n",
      "- 真ん中: Even though its score is 3, it's another important word using the same kanji but different reading. However, since we have to choose between including it or not, perhaps it's better to include it as Important if it's useful.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, no. The user instruction says that words learned directly after the kanji should only be those that are useful and represent important readings. So for each kanji, at least one word needs to be included with its most important reading.\n",
      "\n",
      "Looking at 中 (ちゅう) and 中 (なか):\n",
      "\n",
      "- For 中, the primary reading is なか, which is high priority, so the word 中 (なか) should be Important.\n",
      "- For 真ん中, it's a compound but uses なか as part of it. Since it's also an important word, perhaps include it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Similarly, 世の中 uses なか and has a higher score than others except 中 (なか). So maybe both 中 (なか) and 世の中 should be Important because they have high scores.\n",
      "\n",
      "But let me count how many kanji each word represents:\n",
      "\n",
      "- 中級: contains 中\n",
      "- 中学校: contains 中\n",
      "- 真ん中: contains 真 and 中\n",
      "- 世の中: contains 世 and 中\n",
      "\n",
      "So for the kanji 中, we have multiple words. The most important reading is なか (score 5). So the word 中 (なか) should definitely be Important.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, considering the other words:\n",
      "\n",
      "- 中級 uses ちゅう with a score of 3.\n",
      "- 中学校 uses ちゅう as well, same score.\n",
      "- 真ん中 uses まんなか and なか, both readings. The score is 3, but it's a useful word.\n",
      "- 世の中 uses よ and なか, with the highest score among all words (4).\n",
      "\n",
      "Since each kanji needs at least one important word, for 中 we have 中 (なか) as essential. For 真 and 世, they are part of compound words.\n",
      "\n",
      "Therefore, I think:\n",
      "\n",
      "Important: 中 (なか), 中級, 中学校, 真ん中, 世の中\n",
      "\n",
      "But that can't be right because the user wants to split them into Important and Not-important. Maybe I'm overcomplicating.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, the instruction says that for each kanji, if a word is not useful or doesn't represent an important reading, it should be learned later. So maybe only certain words are essential.\n",
      "\n",
      "Looking again:\n",
      "\n",
      "For 中 (kanji), the most important readings are なか (5) and ちゅう (2). The word 中 (なか) itself has the highest score, so that's essential.\n",
      "\n",
      "The other words using 中:\n",
      "\n",
      "- 中級: uses ちゅう, which is less important than なか. So maybe it can be Not-important.\n",
      "- 中学校: same as above.\n",
      "- 真ん中 and 世の中 both use なか, but they are compound words. Since their scores are lower (3 and 4), perhaps only 世の中 with score 4 should be Important, while the others go to Not-important.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alternatively, maybe select the highest scoring words for Important:\n",
      "\n",
      "Important: 中 (なか) (5), 世の中 (4). Then 真ん中 (3) is next. But perhaps it's better to include all high-scored ones in Important and leave none as Not-important? No, that can't be.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, I think the key is per kanji:\n",
      "\n",
      "For 中:\n",
      "- At least one word with its most important reading must be Important. So 中 (なか) is essential.\n",
      "- Other words using 中 can be either Important or Not-important based on their own scores.\n",
      "\n",
      "So:\n",
      "\n",
      "Important: 中 (なか), 世の中 (4), 真ん中 (3). But I need to decide which ones are the most critical.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alternatively, perhaps select only the top two highest-scored words for Important and put others as Not-important. So:\n",
      "\n",
      "Important: 中 (5), 世の中 (4)\n",
      "\n",
      "Not-important: 中級, 中学校, 真ん中\n",
      "\n",
      "But wait, 真ん中 is a common word, so maybe it should be Important.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alternatively, since 世の中 uses both 世 and 中, which are two kanji, perhaps include it as Important. Similarly, 真ん中 is also a useful word.\n",
      "\n",
      "This is getting confusing. Maybe the best approach is to select all words with scores above a certain threshold (like 3) as Important, but I'm not sure.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alternatively, since each word has its own score, and the user wants to categorize them:\n",
      "\n",
      "Looking at the scores:\n",
      "- 中 (なか):5\n",
      "- 世の中:4\n",
      "- 真ん中:3\n",
      "- 中級, 中学校:3\n",
      "\n",
      "So perhaps:\n",
      "\n",
      "Important: 中 (なか), 世の中, 真ん中\n",
      "\n",
      "Not-important: 中級, 中学校\n",
      "\n",
      "Because they have lower scores.\n",
      "\n",
      "But the user said \"I am going to teach you a word. It has two parts.\" Wait no, looking back at the initial message, the user hasn't provided specific words yet; this is their thought process.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait no, in the problem statement, it's about how to categorize the words into Important and Not-important based on whether they are useful or represent important readings for each kanji.\n",
      "\n",
      "So perhaps:\n",
      "\n",
      "For each kanji in a word, if any of its readings is an important reading (like なか for 中), then the word should be in Important. Otherwise, it goes to Not-important.\n",
      "\n",
      "But since all words contain at least one kanji with an important reading, maybe all are Important? That can't be right because the user wants some to be Not-important.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, no. The user's instruction is: \"words which have not got any useful or important readings should go in 'Not-important'\".\n",
      "\n",
      "So if a word has any useful/important reading for any of its kanji, it goes into Important; else, Not-important.\n",
      "\n",
      "Given that:\n",
      "\n",
      "- 中 (なか): has 5, so Important\n",
      "- 中級: has ちゅう (2), which is less important than なか. But since 2 is still a score, maybe it's considered useful? Or perhaps only scores above a certain threshold are considered important.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, the initial problem didn't specify how to determine \"useful\" or \"important\". Maybe the user is using their own judgment based on the scores provided (5 being highest). So likely:\n",
      "\n",
      "- Words with higher scores are more Important; lower ones can be Not-important.\n",
      "\n",
      "So:\n",
      "\n",
      "Important: 中 (なか) (5), 世の中 (4)\n",
      "\n",
      "Not-important: 中級 (3), 中学校 (3), 真ん中 (3)\n",
      "\n",
      "But wait, 真ん中 has a score of 3, which is still higher than some. Alternatively, perhaps all words with scores >=3 are Important.\n",
      "\n",
      "But that might mean all except those below 3. But in this case, the lowest is 2 and 3, so maybe:\n",
      "\n",
      "Important: All words with score >=3 (so 中 (5), 世の中 (4), 真ん中 (3))\n",
      "\n",
      "Not-important: 中 (ちゅう) (2)\n",
      "\n",
      "But wait, that's not quite right because 中 (ちゅう) is part of other words.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alternatively, maybe separate each word into Important if any of its readings are high. Since all except 中 (ちゅう) have scores >=3, which might make them Important.\n",
      "\n",
      "This is getting too convoluted. I think the best approach is to list all words and decide based on their scores:\n",
      "\n",
      "- 5: 中 (なか)\n",
      "- 4: 世の中\n",
      "- 3: 真ん中, 中級, 中学校\n",
      "\n",
      "So perhaps:\n",

      "Important: 中 (5), 世の中 (4), 真ん中 (3)\n",
      "\n",
      "Not-important: 中級 (3), 中学校 (3) - but they are both 3, so maybe include them as Important too.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alternatively, the user might have intended to put all words with score >=3 in Important and below 3 in Not-important. Since only 中 (ちゅう) is at 2, it goes to Not-important.\n",
      "\n",
      "But I think the key is that each word's status depends on whether it contains any kanji with an important reading. So:\n",
      "\n",
      "- 中 (なか): has an important reading (5), so Important\n",
      "- 中級: has ちゅう (2), which might be less important, but since it's a compound word, maybe still useful. Alternatively, if the score is considered, 3 might make it Important.\n",
      "\n",
      "In any case, I think the user wants to categorize words based on their scores into Important or Not-important, so:\n",
      "\n",
      "Important: Words with higher scores (>=4)\n",
      "Not-important: Lower scores\n",
      "\n",
      "But this isn't clear without more context. Given that, perhaps proceed as:\n",
      "\n",
      "- Important: 中 (5), 世の中 (4)\n",
      "- Not-important: 真ん中 (3), 中級 (3), 中学校 (3)\n",
      "\n",
      "Alternatively, considering that even a score of 3 might still be useful, include all with >=3 in Important.\n",
      "\n",
      "But to avoid overcomplicating, I'll proceed with the initial thought:\n",
      "\n",
      "Important: 中 (5), 世の中 (4)\n",
      "Not-important: 真ん中 (3), 中級 (3), 中学校 (3)\n",
      "\n",
      "However, this seems a bit harsh. Alternatively, all words except those with the lowest score go into Important.\n",
      "\n",
      "In conclusion, perhaps categorize as follows based on scores:\n",

      "But since the user hasn't specified exact cutoffs, it's a bit ambiguous. Therefore, perhaps all words except those with no useful readings are Important.\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "Important: All words provided\n",

      "\n",
      "First, I need to understand the criteria for sorting them. The instructions say that some words should be learned directly after the kanji if they're useful and represent important readings. Otherwise, they should be learned later.\n",
      "\n",
      "Looking at 解雇 (かいこ), it's a two-kanji word with the reading かいこ and an importance score of 0. Since the score is low, maybe it's not considered very important. But I also need to think about whether this word is commonly used or if it's useful for learning the kanji 解.\n",
      "\n",
      "解雇 means \"dismissal\" or \"termination,\" often in a workplace context. It's a business-related term and might be more advanced or less common, so it's understandable that its importance score is low. Therefore, I might categorize this as not-important because it's less likely to be immediately useful for learning the kanji 解.\n",
      "\n",
      "Next, 雇*う (やとう) has an importance score of 3, which is higher than 0. This word is 雇う, meaning \"to hire\" or \"to employ.\" The kanji here is 雇, and it's read as やとう in this context. Since the score is 3, which isn't very high but still moderate, I should consider whether learning this word is essential for understanding the kanji.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, 雇*う might have other readings or uses that are more common. For example, 雇主 (ひろ为主) means \"employer,\" which is another important reading. Since 雇*う's importance score is 3, it's still somewhat useful but maybe not the most essential reading for learning the kanji.\n",
      "\n",
      "The user also mentioned that at least one word should be important to learn the most important reading of the word. But in this case, 解雇 might not be the best example since its reading is less common. Instead, focusing on 雇*う could help learners understand a more basic or frequently used form.\n",
      "\n",
      "Considering all these factors, I think 解雇 (かいこ) should go into the not-important list because it's less useful and has a low importance score. On the other hand, 雇*う (やとう) might still be somewhat important but perhaps not as crucial as other possible words for the kanji 雇.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, but maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Since 解雇 is the only word with the kanji 解, and its score is 0, it's definitely not important. For 雇*う, even though the score is 3, there might be a more essential reading that should take precedence, so this one could go into not-important as well.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, putting it all together, both words are considered not-important because 解雇 has a low score and isn't very useful, while 雇*う's higher score still doesn't make it essential for learning the kanji effectively.\n",

      "First, they mentioned that each word has a certain kanji and an importance score from 0 to 5. My task is to decide which words should be learned directly after the kanji (Important) and which ones should be saved for later (Not-important). The key points they highlighted are:\n",

      "Wait, but the user said that if a word isn't useful or doesn't represent an important reading, it should go into 'not-important.' So perhaps 西側 could be considered not as essential compared to left and right sides. However, I think including all directional sides is beneficial, so maybe it's still worth learning early.\n",
      "\n",
      "But since the scores for 左側 and 右側 are higher (5), they definitely take precedence. 側 has a lower score (3) but might be less critical without more context. 西側 also has a 3 but includes another kanji (西) which is part of other words, so maybe it's better to include it as important.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alternatively, if I'm supposed to choose only the most essential, perhaps 側 isn't as useful on its own since it's often combined with other terms. So, it might be more efficient to learn 左側 and 右側 first because they are high priority and cover specific directions, while 西側 can wait.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, but the user mentioned that at least one word should be important for each kanji to learn the most important reading. So for 側, since its main reading is \"kawa,\" which is part of 左側 and 右側, maybe it's better not to include 側 as a separate flashcard yet because those more specific terms are already being learned. Therefore, 側 can be in the 'not-important' list for now.\n",
      "\n",
      "Putting it all together:\n",
      "\n",
      "Important: 左側 右側 西側\n",
      "Not-important: 側\n",
      "\n",
      "But wait, I should check if each kanji is covered by at least one important word. The kanji are 側, 左, 右, and 西. \n",
      "\n",
      "- 左 is covered by 左側 (important)\n",
      "- 右 is covered by 右側 (important)\n",
      "- 西 is covered by 西側 (if I include it as important)\n",
      "- 側 isn't covered unless I make a word for it.\n",
      "\n",
      "But if I put 西側 in 'not-important,' then the kanji 西 wouldn't have an important word, which goes against the rule. So perhaps I need to include 西側 as important to cover the kanji 西.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alternatively, maybe 側 can be considered not important because its main reading is covered by other words, but if I don't include it at all, then the user might miss that kanji's primary meaning. Hmm, this is a bit confusing.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, perhaps the rule is that each kanji must have at least one word that teaches its primary reading as important. So for 側, the main reading is \"kawa,\" but since 左側 and 右側 are more specific and use 側 in their readings, maybe it's better to include those instead of 側 itself.\n",
      "\n",
      "Therefore, I think:\n",
      "\n",
      "Important: 左側 右측 西側\n",
      "Not-important: 側\n",
      "\n",
      "But wait, that would leave the kanji 側 without an important word. Maybe I need to reconsider. If the user wants each kanji's primary reading covered by at least one important word, then perhaps 側 should be included as important because it teaches the base \"kawa\" meaning.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alternatively, if the words 左側 and 右側 already cover the use of 側 in their readings, maybe the individual kanji 側 doesn't need a separate word. But I'm not sure about that; perhaps each kanji should have its own flashcard regardless.\n",
      "\n",
      "This is getting a bit tangled. To sum up:\n",
      "\n",
      "- High importance words: 左側 and 右側 (both 5)\n",
      "- Lower but still useful: 西측 (3)\n",
      "- Perhaps 側 can be learned later as it's covered by the others, so not important for now.\n",
      "\n",
      "So final decision:\n",
      "\n",
      "Important: 左側 右侧 西侧\n",
      "Not-important: 側\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, no, the user included all four words. So perhaps I should list them accordingly. Let me make sure each kanji is represented in at least one important word.\n",
      "\n",
      "- 側: covered by 側 itself or by 左側 and 右側.\n",
      "- 左: covered by 左侧\n",
      "- 右: covered by 右侧\n",
      "- 西: covered by 西侧\n",
      "\n",
      "If I include 側 as not-important, then the kanji 側 wouldn't have an important word. But if it's included in the important list, that might be necessary.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alternatively, maybe the user wants the words to be split based on their own importance regardless of the kanji. So perhaps:\n",
      "\n",
      "Important: 左侧 右侧\n",
      "Not-important: 側 西侧\n",
      "\n",
      "But then the scores matter too. Both left and right are 5, so definitely important. 西侧 is 3, which might still make it important but less so than others. Maybe all except 側 should be important because they have higher scores.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, I'm overcomplicating. The user's instruction says that for the kanji, at least one word must represent an important reading. So for each kanji in the words provided (側, 左, 右, 西), there should be at least one important word linked to it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Therefore:\n",
      "\n",
      "- For 側: if I include any word containing 側 as important, then it's covered.\n",
      "- For 左: 左侧 is important\n",
      "- For 右: 右侧 is important\n",
      "- For 西: 西侧 is important\n",
      "\n",
      "Thus, all words except maybe 側 can be considered. But since 側 is a separate kanji, if I don't include it as an important word, then perhaps the user won't have that kanji's primary meaning covered.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alternatively, perhaps the primary reading of each kanji must be taught by at least one important word. So:\n",
      "\n",
      "- For 側: its main reading is \"kawa\" which might not be directly in any other word except itself.\n",
      "- Therefore, if I don't include 側 as an important word, then the user won't learn that meaning.\n",
      "\n",
      "So perhaps it's better to include all words with high scores (left and right) as important, and decide on 西侧 and 側 based on their scores.\n",
      "\n",
      "Given that, since 左侧 and 右侧 are 5, they're definitely important. 西侧 is 3, which might still be considered important. 側 is 3 but it's a single kanji. Maybe it's better to include both 西侧 and 側 as important.\n",
      "\n",
      "But the user said \"I am going to study all of these,\" so maybe they want to prioritize based on importance.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alternatively, perhaps only words with higher scores (like 5) are considered important, while others can be in not-important. But I'm not sure about that.\n",
      "\n",
      "In any case, given the confusion and the need to follow instructions, I think:\n",
      "\n",
      "Important: 左侧 右侧\n",
      "Not-important: 側 西侧\n",
      "\n",
      "But since 西侧 is 3 and perhaps still useful, maybe it's better to include it as important. So final split:\n",

The user provided four words: 積＊む (つむ, 3), 累積的 (せっきょくてき, 3), 面積 (めんせき, 1), and 積＊もる (つもる, 2). Each has a kanji with a certain reading and an importance score from 0 to 5.\n",

      "\n",
      "Alternatively, perhaps the user meant 結＊む or another kanji, but I'll proceed as given.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, perhaps the second word is actually 累積的 (tsu seki teki), which uses 累 and 積. So it's a different kanji altogether from the first and fourth words.\n",

      "2. 累積的 (sekk... wait, the user wrote it as 累積的 (せっきょくてき, 3). So the word is 累積的, which likely has two kanji: 累 and 積. But in terms of readings, perhaps it's \"tsu\" and \"seki.\" The importance score is 3.\n",
      "3. 面積 (men seki, 1): Kanji is 面 (men) and 積 (seki). Importance score is 1.\n",

      "- 累積的: focusing on 累 or 積? It's likely both, but perhaps the main one is 累.\n",

      "\n",
      "累積的 (tsu seki teki): likely uses the kanji 累 and 積. The reading for 累 is usually \"tsu,\" and 積 is \"seki.\" This is a compound word meaning something like \"cumulative\" or \"accumulated.\" It's more of an advanced vocabulary, but it does involve common readings.\n",
      "\n",
      "面積 (men seki): uses 面 (usually おも or めん) and 積 (seki). The reading here for 面 is \"めん,\" which is a common reading. So this word is about area in geometry, common in math contexts.\n",
      "\n",
      "積＊もる: uses 積 with the reading \"tsu mo ru.\" This is an archaic or literary reading, perhaps from classical Japanese, so it's less commonly used today.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, considering importance:\n",
      "\n",
      "- 面積 (men seki) is probably more important because it's a common word in mathematics and everyday contexts where area is discussed. The readings are standard for both kanji.\n",
      "- 累積的 might be useful but is likely more specialized vocabulary, so perhaps less important unless one is studying advanced terms.\n",
      "- 積＊む and 積＊もる have readings that are less common, especially \"tsu mo ru,\" which is archaic. So these may not be as crucial for general learning.\n",
      "\n",
      "Therefore, I would classify 面積 as Important due to its high utility and frequency of use. The others might be considered Not-important unless there's a specific need to learn them.\n",
      "\n",
      "But wait, the user specified that each word contains a certain kanji, so perhaps each card is tied to one kanji. Let me consider each kanji separately:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. For 積: associated with words 積＊む and 積＊もる. Both have readings for 積 that are less common. However, 積 also has more common readings like つま (as in くず積む) or せき (as in 面積). So if the flashcard is about 積, then it's important to know both the common and less common readings. Therefore, including at least one word with a common reading would be Important.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. For 累: the word 累積的 uses 累 with reading \"tsu.\" This is a common reading for 累, so if focusing on 累, this word would be Important as it's a standard usage.\n",

      "伝統文化は、各民族や地域が長い年月をかけて築き上げた知恵と価値観の結晶です。現代社会では、スピード重視の生活様式が普及し、古い習慣や文化を取り入れる機会が減少しています。しかし、伝統文化には現代人が忘れかけている大切な事柄が多く含まれています。\n",
      "\n",
      "まず、伝統文化は人間関係を強める重要な役割を持っています。例えば、日本の茶道は、一期一会の精神に基づき、ホストとゲストとの相互尊重を重視します。このような文化を通じて、人々がお互いに敬意を払う習慣が維持され、社会の調和が保たれます。\n",
      "\n",
      "次に、伝統文化は環境への配慮を教えてくれます。中国の四礵列島では、住民たちが自然と調和して暮らすための知恵が詰まった文化があります。例えば、漁労技術や造林方法は、持続可能性を重視したもので、現代の環境問題を考える上で貴重な教訓を与えるでしょう。\n",
      "\n",
      "さらに、伝統文化は自己理解を深めるきっかけとしても重要です。インドのヨガや瞑想は、身体と心のバランスを取り戻すための方法であり、自我認識に役立ちます。このような文化活動を通じて、個人が自分自身と向き合い、内側から成長する機会を得られます。\n",
      "\n",
      "しかし、伝統文化の価値を理解せず、近代化の中で失われていくものは少なくありません。例えば、手工艺技術や口承文化は、若い世代への伝承不足により、次第に廃れつつあります。だからこそ、現代人は伝統文化の保護と継承に努める必要があります。\n",

      "\n",
      "Now, considering each word:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **浜 (はま, 1)**: The importance score is low (1), so maybe it's less important.\n",
      "2. **山 (やま, 5)**: High score, probably important.\n",
      "3. **森 (もり, 4)**: Also high score, likely important.\n",
      "4. **川 (かわ, 3)**: Moderate score, could be either but leaning towards important.\n",
      "5. **石 (いし, 2)**: Lower score, maybe not as critical.\n",
      "6. **木 (き, 5)**: High score, important.\n",
      "7. **花 (はな, 4)**: High score, important.\n",
      "8. **風 (かぜ, 3)**: Moderate, possibly important.\n",
      "9. **雨 (あめ, 2)**: Lower, maybe not as crucial.\n",
      "10. **日 (ひ, 5)**: Very high, definitely important.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, but in the example given by the user, they only had 浜 and placed it in the important list despite the low score. Maybe I should prioritize based on the scores rather than my own judgment unless instructed otherwise.\n",

      "1. 売＊れる (うれる, 3)\n",

      "Each of these words shares the kanji '売' except for 販売 and 商売, which use different kanji but still relate to selling or commerce.\n",
      "\n",
      "Starting with 売＊れる: The reading is うれる, importance score 3. This word means \"to sell\" in a sense that something gets sold without direct involvement of the speaker. It's a common verb, so it might be important.\n",
      "\n",
      "Next, 売＊る (うる, 5): This is another form of '売る', meaning to sell. The higher importance score suggests it's more critical. Both 売＊る and 売＊れる are different conjugations of the same verb, but they represent different grammatical usages.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then we have 售春婦 (ばいしゅんふ, 1): This translates to \"prostitute\" or \"sex worker.\" It's a specific term with a negative connotation and has a low importance score. It might not be as useful in general vocabulary but is still related to the kanji.\n",
      "\n",
      "販売 (はんばい, 3): This means \"sales\" or \"distribution.\" It's a noun form of selling, commonly used in business contexts. The score is medium-high.\n",
      "\n",
      "商売 (しょうばい, 4): Meaning \"business\" or \"trade,\" it's also a noun and has a higher importance score than 販売.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, I need to categorize these:\n",
      "\n",
      "- Important words should be those that are useful and represent important readings of their kanji. Since '売' is the primary kanji here, but in 贩売 and 商売, the kanji changes. However, all these words relate to selling or commerce.\n",
      "\n",
      "For 売＊る (うる, 5): It's a high importance score and represents a core verb form of selling, so it should be important.\n",
      "\n",
      "売＊れる (うれる, 3) is also useful as another conjugation, but since the user said \"directly after kanji,\" perhaps only one form is needed. However, it's still quite common.\n",
      "\n",
      "販売 (はんばい, 3) and 商売 (しょうばい, 4): Both are important in business contexts. 商売 has a higher score, so maybe include that as important, while 贩売 could be considered not-important if we prioritize higher scores.\n",
      "\n",
      "売春婦 (ばいしゅんふ, 1) is negative and less commonly used, so it's probably not important for basic learning.\n",
      "\n",
      "Therefore, the important list would include 売＊る, 贩売, and 商売. But wait, do I need to consider each kanji? The user mentioned that all words contain a certain kanji but didn't specify if multiple kanji are involved. Since some words have multiple kanji (like 商売 has two), but the main focus is on the primary kanji.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, actually, looking back, the user said \"All words contain a certain kanji.\" So each word is tied to one specific kanji. For example, 売＊る relates to '売', 贩売 might relate to '販' or '売'? Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alternatively, perhaps each word's main kanji is the focus, but some have multiple. Maybe it's better to group by their primary kanji.\n",
      "\n",
      "But regardless, based on the user's instruction, I should categorize the words as Important and Not-important. The important ones are those that are useful for learning the kanji's readings, especially the most important ones.\n",
      "\n",
      "Given that, 売＊る has a high score (5), so it's definitely important. 贩売 (3) is also important in business contexts, and 商売 (4) as well. But since the user wants to split into two lists, perhaps only the top ones go into Important.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, but the user said \"all words may be classified as important,\" but we can have some as not-important if they're less useful. So maybe 売＊る is important, and others are not, or perhaps include the higher scores.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alternatively, considering that each kanji needs at least one important word, but here all the words share '売' except for 贩売 and 商売 which have different kanji but still relate to selling. Maybe I'm overcomplicating again.\n",
      "\n",
      "I think the best approach is to select the top two based on importance scores:\n",
      "\n",
      "- 売＊る (5)\n",
      "- 商売 (4)\n",
      "\n",
      "Then, include either 贩売 or 売＊れる as important if needed, but since the user allows some not-important ones, perhaps only the highest go into Important.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, no. The user said that at least one word per kanji should be important to cover the most important reading. So for '売', we need at least one important word. Since 売＊る has a higher score, it's essential. The other words can be not-important if they're less useful.\n",
      "\n",
      "Thus:\n",
      "\n",
      "Important: 売＊る, 商売\n",
      "Not-important: 売＊れる, 售春婦, 贩売\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, but 商売 uses '商' and '売', so maybe it's better to include it as important. Also, 贩売 is about sales, which is useful.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alternatively, perhaps only the top two go into Important.\n",
      "\n",
      "Hmm, I'm a bit confused, but based on the user's example response, they included three in Important and two in Not-important. So perhaps all except one are important.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait no, looking at the example given by the user:\n",
      "\n",
      "They listed:\n",
      "\n",
      "Important: 一*つ, 食べる\n",
      "Not-important: 犬＊, 三＊\n",
      "\n",
      "So the user's assistant included two in Important and two in Not-important.\n",
      "\n",
      "But in this case, we have five words. So likely, three important and two not.\n",
      "\n",
      "Given that, I think 売＊る (5), 商売 (4), 贩売 (3) would be important as they all relate to selling and business with higher scores. Then, 售春婦 is low score, so not important, and 売＊れる could be either.\n",
      "\n",
      "But the user's instruction says that for less important kanji, it's acceptable to have less important words. So maybe only include the highest for each kanji, but I'm not sure.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alternatively, perhaps all except 售春婦 are important because they're more useful, even if their scores are lower than others.\n",
      "\n",
      "But given the scores:\n",
      "\n",
      "- 売＊る: 5\n",
      "- 商売:4\n",

      "- 売＊れる:3\n",

      "\n",
      "First, I see that all the words provided contain the same kanji: 元 (also appearing as 足元). The list includes:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. 元 (もと, 3)\n",
      "2. 足元 (あしもと, 2)\n",
      "3. 元気 (げんき, 5)\n",

      "\n",
      "The importance scores are from 0 to 5, with higher numbers being more important.\n",
      "\n",
      "I need to determine which of these should be learned directly after the kanji (important) and which can be learned later (not-important). The key is that the words learned immediately after a kanji should only include those that are useful or represent important readings. \n",
      "\n",
      "Looking at each word:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. 元 (もと, 3): This is a basic reading for the kanji '元'. Since it's an intermediate importance score, maybe it's good to learn early.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. 足元 (あしもと, 2): This is another reading, but it's lower in importance (score 2). Maybe not as crucial to learn right away.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. 元気 (げんき, 5): High importance score (5), so this should definitely be learned early as it represents a key reading and is useful.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. 元々 (もともと, 4): Another important reading with a high score (4). This should also be considered important to learn early.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. 元 (もと, 4): Same kanji '元' but the same as the first entry but with a slightly higher score. Since it's an important reading, perhaps this is another one to include in the important list.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, but some of these are readings for the same kanji. I need to make sure that at least one word per kanji should be considered important to learn its most important reading.\n",
      "\n",
      "But looking back, maybe each word is a separate entry, even if they share the same kanji. So I have five entries here.\n",
      "\n",
      "I think the approach would be:\n",
      "\n",
      "- For each kanji, identify which readings are more important and which can be deferred.\n",
      "\n",
      "The kanji '元' appears in multiple words with different readings and scores. The highest scores for '元' are 4 (from 元々 and another entry). So those should be considered important. \n",
      "\n",
      "But then, 足元 has a lower score, so it might not need to be learned immediately.\n",
      "\n",
      "So the important list would include the high-score words: 元气 (げんき,5), 元々(もともと,4), and both instances of 元 with scores 3 and 4. But wait, perhaps I should consider each word separately rather than per kanji.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, but the task is to sort all the provided words into important or not based on their individual importance. So each word is a separate entity.\n",
      "\n",
      "So looking at each:\n",
      "\n",
      "- 元 (もと, 3): score 3\n",
      "- 足元 (あしもと,2): score 2\n",
      "- 元气 (げんき,5): score 5\n",
      "- 元々 (もともと,4): score4\n",
      "- 元 (もと,4): score4\n",
      "\n",
      "So the important ones would be those with higher scores. So anything above maybe 3 or 4? Or just based on their individual importance.\n",
      "\n",
      "But I think each word's importance is given, so we can use that.\n",
      "\n",
      "Scores:\n",
      "\n",
      "5: most important, 4: very important, 3: somewhat, 2: less, 1: least.\n",
      "\n",
      "So the words with scores 5,4 are definitely important. The ones with 3 and lower can be considered not as important.\n",
      "\n",
      "But wait, the instructions say \"the words that are learned directly after the kanji should only be words that are useful and represent important readings.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "So for each kanji, at least one word should be important to learn its most important reading. But since these are separate words, perhaps all high-scored ones are important.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, but in this case, some of the same kanji have multiple entries with different readings. So I think that if a word has a higher importance score, it's more likely to be important to include early.\n",
      "\n",
      "So let me go through each:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. 元 (もと, 3): important? Maybe, because it's a basic reading for '元'.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. 足元 (あしもと,2): less important.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. 元气 (げんき,5): definitely important.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. 元々 (もともと,4): very important.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. 元 (もと,4): also an important reading.\n",
      "\n",
      "So considering each word's score, the ones with 4 and above should be in the important list. So that would be 元气, 元々, and 元 (the one with 4). The other '元' has a 3, which is lower, so maybe not as crucial. But perhaps since it's another reading of the same kanji, we might include it.\n",
      "\n",
      "But looking at the response format, I think that the user wants the important list to have words that are essential for learning the most important readings.\n",
      "\n",
      "So perhaps all the high-scored ones (5,4) plus maybe one 3 if necessary. But since some kanji have multiple readings, but in this case, we might include the higher scores and leave the lower ones for later.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alternatively, perhaps all of these except 足元 are important because they relate to '元' with high scores, while 足元 is a separate word that's less important.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, looking again: \n",
      "\n",
      "The words provided are:\n",
      "\n",
      "- 元 (also appears in 足元 and others). So '足元' is another word containing the kanji '足' and '元'. Wait no, 足元 is one word with two kanji. But in this list, all words contain a certain kanji, which could be either.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, maybe each word is tied to its own kanji, but in this case, some share the same kanji. So perhaps it's better to group by kanji and select important readings per kanji.\n",
      "\n",
      "But according to the user, \"All words may be classified as important. But for less important kanji it is acceptable to have less important words.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, I'm a bit confused now. Let me try to rephrase the problem.\n",
      "\n",
      "The task is: given several words with their importance scores, decide which are important (to learn after the kanji) and which can be learned later.\n",
      "\n",
      "Important criteria:\n",
      "\n",
      "- Words that are useful and represent important readings should be in the important list.\n",
      "\n",
      "So for each word, if it's useful (high importance score) or represents an important reading of its kanji, include it in the important list. Otherwise, it goes to not-important.\n",
      "\n",
      "In this case, we have five words with varying scores.\n",
      "\n",
      "Looking at their scores:\n",
      "\n",
      "- 元 (もと, 3): score 3\n",
      "- 足元 (あしもと,2): score 2\n",
      "- 元气 (げんき,5): score 5\n",
      "- 元々 (もともと,4): score4\n",
      "- 元 (もと,4): score4\n",
      "\n",
      "So the highest scores are 5 and 4s. The lower ones are 3 and 2.\n",
      "\n",
      "I think that any word with a score of 4 or higher should be considered important because they're high on the scale. So:\n",
      "\n",
      "Important: 元気 (げんき,5), 元々 (もともと,4), 元 (もと,4)\n",
      "\n",
      "Not-important: 元 (もと,3), 足元 (あしもと,2)\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, but '足元' is a word that contains the kanji '足' and '元', but it's a separate word. So if we're considering each word individually for importance, then yes.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alternatively, perhaps all words except those with score 3 and below are important. But since some have lower scores, they should go to not-important.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, the instructions don't specify a cutoff, just that \"words that are useful and represent important readings.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "So perhaps any word with a score above 2 or something is important. But without a specific cutoff, maybe all except those clearly low.\n",
      "\n",
      "But given that, in this case, I think it's safe to include all words with scores of 4 and above as important, and the rest as not.\n",
      "\n",
      "Therefore:\n",
      "\n",
      "Important: 元气 (5), 元々 (4), 元 (4)\n",
      "\n",
      "Not-important: 元 (3), 足元 (2)\n",
      "\n",
      "So in the response format:\n",

      "\n",
      "不重要：元（もう一つ）、足元\n",

      "Looking at the words:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. 要*する (ようする, 3): The kanji here is 要 with the reading \"よう\". The score is 3, which seems significant.\n",

Wait, no—each entry in the list is a separate word containing certain kanji. So each of these words contributes to the learning of their respective kanji.\n",
      "3. 要 (かなめ, 0): This is the kanji 要 alone with reading \"かなめ\", which has a score of 0. That might be less important on its own.\n",

      "\n",
      "Looking at the kanji in each word:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. 要*する: 要 (reading \"よう\" as part of する)\n",
      "2. 重要: 重 and 要\n",
      "3. 要: 要 alone\n",
      "4. 要求: 要 and 求\n",
      "5. 需要: 需 and 要\n",
      "6. 要*る: 要\n",
      "\n",
      "But I think the key is to consider each word as a separate entity contributing to the kanji they contain. So, for example:\n",
      "\n",
      "- For the kanji 要:\n",
      "  - 要*する (score 3)\n",
      "  - 要求 (score 2)\n",
      "  - 要 (score 0)\n",
      "  - 要*る (score 0)\n",
      "\n",
      "So if we're looking to learn the most important reading of 要 first, 要*する with score 3 is essential. The others have lower scores or are standalone.\n",
      "\n",
      "Similarly, for other kanji:\n",
      "\n",
      "- 重: In 重要 (score 4), which is quite high.\n",
      "- 需: In 需要 (score 2)\n",
      "- 求: In 要求 (score 2)\n",
      "\n",
      "But the user's focus seems to be on grouping the provided words into important and not-important, based on whether they should be learned directly after their kanji or later.\n",
      "\n",
      "So perhaps each word is a separate entry for its own kanji. But since some words have multiple kanji, like 重要 (two kanji), it's a bit tricky.\n",

      "So each word in the list is associated with certain kanji (possibly multiple), and for learning purposes, we want to prioritize words that teach important readings of those kanji.\n",
      "\n",
      "The importance score can guide this. Words with higher scores are more important to learn early.\n",
      "\n",
      "Looking at the list:\n",

      "- 要*する (3) – high\n",
      "- 重要 (4) – very high\n",

      "- 需要 (2) – medium\n",
      "- 要*る (0) – low\n",

      "So the important words should be those with higher scores, as they represent key readings. Therefore:\n",

      "Important: 重要 (4), 要*する (3), 要求 (2), 需要 (2)\n",
      "Not-important: 要 (0), 要*る (0)\n",
      "\n",
      "But wait, the user's example response only has two words in important and the rest in not-important. Maybe I need to reconsider.\n",
      "\n",
      "Perhaps each word is associated with specific kanji, so for each kanji, we pick at least one word that teaches its most important reading.\n",
      "\n",
      "Looking again:\n",
      "\n",
      "- For 要: the readings are よう (in 要*する, 3), かなめ (0), and いる (0). So the important word is 要*する.\n",
      "- For 重: in 重要, which has a high score of 4. So 重要 should be important.\n",
      "- For 需: in 需要, which is 2. But since it's paired with 要, maybe focus on the kanji 需? Or perhaps not necessary if 要 is already covered by 要*する.\n",
      "- 求: in 要求 (2), but again, if we're focusing on the main kanji, maybe not essential.\n",
      "\n",
      "But I think the approach is to look at each word's score and decide if it's important enough to be learned early. So 重要 (4) and 要*する (3) are definitely important. The others have lower scores but still might be considered. However, since the user example only lists two in important, perhaps they consider up to a certain threshold.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alternatively, maybe each kanji should have at least one word that teaches its main reading. So for each kanji in these words:\n",

      "- 重: include 重要 (4)\n",
      "- 需: include 需要 (2) – but if we've already covered with higher scores, maybe not\n",

      "\n",
      "But the user's instruction is to sort all provided words into two lists.\n",

      "Not-important: 要 (0), 要*る (0), 要求 (2), 需要 (2)\n",

      "\n",
      "1. 浮＊かれる (うかれる, 1)\n",

      "Each word has a kanji and a reading along with an importance score from 0 to 5. The task is to decide which words should be learned directly after the kanji (important) and which ones can be learned later (not-important).\n",
      "\n",
      "I think the key here is to prioritize words that are useful and represent important readings of the kanji. Also, at least one word per kanji should be important to cover the most crucial reading.\n",
      "\n",
      "Looking at the first word: 浮＊かれる (うかれる, 1). The reading is \"ukareshi,\" which I believe means \"to float\" or \"be floating.\" The importance score here is 1, which is lower. Since it's a basic form and probably a common use of the kanji 浮, maybe it should be considered important because knowing this helps understand the core meaning.\n",
      "\n",
      "Next, 浮*く (うく, 3). This reading is \"uku,\" also meaning \"to float.\" The score here is 3, which is higher than the first one. But wait, both 浮＊かれる and 浮*く share the same kanji but different readings. I'm a bit confused because sometimes in Japanese, verbs can have different forms with similar meanings but different conjugations. However, \"uku\" might be more common or fundamental.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then we have 浮気 (うわき, 3). The reading is \"uwaki,\" which I know means \"infidelity\" or being unfaithful. This seems like a compound word where 浮 isn't directly related to its meaning anymore; it's part of an idiom. So this might be less important for learning the basic kanji readings and more about vocabulary, so maybe it should go into not-important.\n",
      "\n",
      "Lastly, 浮いてる人 (ういてるひと, 0). This is \"uibiteru hito,\" meaning \"a floating person,\" which I think refers to someone who's drifting or aimless. The score here is 0, the lowest. Since it's a longer compound and less common, it probably should be learned later.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, considering each kanji: 浮 appears in all these words. So we need at least one important word per kanji. But in this case, all four entries use the same kanji, so perhaps only two are needed? Wait, no—each entry is a separate word with the same kanji but different readings.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, actually, each entry might have its own kanji, but looking back: 浮＊かれる has kanji 浮 and かれる (which I think is another kanji, maybe 'かる' as in '浮かる'? Or perhaps it's part of the verb. Maybe I'm overcomplicating.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, no—the words provided are all separate, each with their own readings but using the same kanji '浮.' So for the kanji 浮, we need to choose which words to prioritize.\n",
      "\n",
      "The key is that each word may be classified as important or not based on whether it's useful and represents an important reading. The highest importance scores should definitely go into important.\n",
      "\n",
      "Looking at the scores: 1,3,3,0. So the higher scores are 3s. The first word has a lower score but might still be important because it's a basic form.\n",
      "\n",
      "But perhaps the words with higher scores (3) and useful readings should be in important. Let me think about each:\n",
      "\n",
      "- 浮＊かれる (1): Reading is ukeru, which is a basic verb meaning to float.\n",
      "- 浮*く (3): uku, also a verb but less common? Or maybe more common as part of verbs like 上る?\n",
      "Wait, I might be mixing up. 'Uku' is actually an intransitive verb meaning to rise or float, while 'ukeru' is the transitive form. So both are important, but perhaps 'uku' is more fundamental.\n",
      "\n",
      "浮気 (3): As mentioned earlier, it's a compound and less about the kanji reading.\n",
      "浮いてる人 (0): Not important.\n",
      "\n",
      "So considering that, maybe 浮＊かれる and 浮*く should be in important because they directly relate to the readings of the kanji, while 浮気 is more of an idiom and might be learned later. However, since both have high scores, perhaps only one needs to be selected.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, but the user's instruction was that each word may be classified as important or not, regardless of kanji. But all these words share the same kanji '浮.' So for the kanji 浮, we need at least one important word with its main reading.\n",
      "\n",
      "Looking at the readings:\n",
      "\n",
      "- ukeru: うかれる (important)\n",
      "- uku: うく (also important)\n",
      "- uwaki: うわき (less about reading)\n",
      "-uibiteru: ういてる (probably less important)\n",
      "\n",
      "Since both 浮＊かれる and 浮*く are directly related to the kanji's readings, but their importance scores are 1 and 3 respectively. However, 3 is higher, so perhaps 浮*く should be in important.\n",
      "\n",
      "But wait, maybe I should include the word with the highest score as important, which would be both 浮＊かれる (1) and 浮*く (3). But since we need to choose between them, perhaps only the most useful one is included. Alternatively, if multiple words share the same kanji but different readings, all primary readings should be covered.\n",
      "\n",
      "But I'm getting a bit confused here. Let me try again:\n",
      "\n",
      "The important list should include words that are useful and represent important readings. So for '浮,' the primary readings would likely be うく (uku) and うかれる (ukeru). Both are verb forms, with uku being intransitive and ukeru transitive.\n",
      "\n",
      "Since both have high importance scores (3 and 1), perhaps only the higher one should be chosen. But I'm not sure if the score is the main factor or the utility.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alternatively, maybe all words that have important readings regardless of their own score can be included. So '浮＊かれる' and '浮*く' are both important because they show different readings of the kanji, while '浮気' and '浮いてる人' are not as directly related to the kanji's primary meanings.\n",

      "But wait, looking at the importance scores: 1,3,3,0. So two words have a score of 3, which might be considered important, but maybe only one needs to be selected per kanji. Hmm, no—the user said that all words may be classified as important, but for less important kanji, it's acceptable to have less important words. At least one word should always be important to learn the most important reading.\n",
      "\n",
      "So perhaps the top score is 3, and those with higher scores are more likely to be important. So '浮*く' (3) and '浮気' (3) both have high scores but different usages. However, '浮気' is a compound that doesn't directly relate to the kanji's reading, so it's less important for learning the kanji.\n",
      "\n",
      "Therefore, I think:\n",
      "\n",
      "Important: 浮＊かれる (1), 浮*く (3)\n",
      "Not-important: 浮気 (3), 浮いてる人 (0)\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, but '浮＊かれる' has a lower score than '浮*く.' Maybe only include the higher one. Alternatively, perhaps both are important because they're different readings.\n",
      "\n",
      "I'm not entirely sure, but given that both have scores above zero and relate directly to the kanji's readings, I think including both in important makes sense. But the user's example response included three words as important, which might not be necessary here. Maybe just include the highest ones.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alternatively, perhaps only '浮*く' (3) is important because it has a higher score and is more fundamental, while '浮＊かれる' can be considered less so despite being another reading. But I'm not sure about that.\n",
      "\n",
      "I think to follow instructions, since all words are separate and can be classified as either important or not, the ones with higher scores (3) should be in important, but also considering their relevance to the kanji's readings. So '浮＊かれる' and '浮*く' are both directly related, while the others aren't.\n",

Maybe each word is attached to its kanji, so for example, 帝国 would be the word learned with its kanji. But if there are multiple readings per kanji, only one (the most important) should be covered by a word in the Important list.\n",
      "\n",
      "Hmm, maybe I need to check if each word's reading is the primary or most common reading for that kanji. For instance, 帝国's reading ていこく might be the main one, making it important. Similarly, 時間 (じかん) is a fundamental word, so important.\n",
      "\n",
      "But then, 分からない isn't just a single word; it's a form of 理解, but maybe as a separate word for the same kanji? Or perhaps each entry is a separate word with its own kanji. Wait, I think in this case, each line is a separate word with its own kanji, reading, and importance.\n",

      "Wait no, looking back, the user said \"All words contain a certain kanji.\" So each word has one or more kanji. For example, 一番 (いちばん) is written with three kanji: 一, 本, 番? Or maybe it's one word with multiple kanji.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait no, 一番 is actually two kanji: 一 and 番. So each entry is a word composed of certain kanji, along with its reading and importance score.\n",
      "\n",
      "So the task is to decide for each word (kanji combination) whether it should be learned directly after the kanji or later. The words that are important (high score) and represent key readings should be in Important; others go to Not-important.\n",
      "\n",
      "But I'm a bit confused about how to evaluate each word's importance beyond just the score. Maybe if the score is high, like 5, it's definitely important. Lower scores might not necessarily be unimportant but perhaps less so.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, in the example given by the user, 帝国 (ていこく, 1) was put in Important despite a low score because it's the main reading for that kanji.\n",
      "\n",
      "So I think the approach is: regardless of the score, if the word's reading is a primary or key reading for its kanji, it should be in Important. The importance score can help but isn't the sole determinant.\n",
      "\n",
      "Therefore, for each word, I need to:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Identify the kanji in the word.\n",
      "2. Determine if the reading provided is an important or primary reading for those kanji.\n",
      "3. If yes, add it to Important; else, Not-important.\n",
      "\n",
      "But since I don't have a list of primary readings memorized, perhaps the score can guide me: higher scores mean more importance, so they should be in Important. Lower scores might go into Not-important unless they're essential for the kanji's main reading.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, but the user said that at least one word per kanji should cover the most important reading. So even if a word has a low score, if it covers the primary reading of its kanji, it should be in Important.\n",
      "\n",
      "Therefore, perhaps I need to:\n",
      "\n",
      "- For each word, determine if it's covering the main (most common or important) reading for its kanji.\n",
      "- If yes, add to Important regardless of the score.\n",
      "- If not, then use the score: higher scores go to Important, lower to Not-important.\n",
      "\n",
      "But without knowing the primary readings, I might have to rely on the given scores. Alternatively, maybe the scores are a good indicator.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the example, 帝国 had a score of 1 but was still considered important because it's the main reading for that kanji. So perhaps even low scores can be important if they're key readings.\n",
      "\n",
      "Therefore, my approach should be:\n",
      "\n",
      "- Each word is associated with its kanji.\n",
      "- For each word, decide whether it represents the most common or important reading of its kanji(s).\n",
      "  - If yes: Important.\n",
      "  - If no: check the score; higher scores (like 4 or 5) may still go to Important, lower (1-3) to Not-important.\n",
      "\n",
      "But without knowing all the primary readings, I might have to infer based on common usage. For example:\n",
      "\n",
      "- 時間 (じかん): Common word meaning \"time.\" Very important.\n",
      "- 分からない: Also very common, meaning \"not understanding.\"\n",
      "- 一番 (いちばん): Means \"first\" or \"most,\" used in many expressions.\n",
      "- 一*つ (ひとつ, 4): This seems to be the same as 一つ, which means \"one\" but also has nuances. The score is 4, so important.\n",
      "- 火星 (かせい, 3): Means \"Mars.\" A bit less common, but still a key term in science or space contexts.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, but I'm not entirely sure about all these. Maybe some are more important than others based on frequency and usage in everyday language versus specialized terms.\n",
      "\n",
      "Given that, perhaps the words with scores of 4 and 5 should definitely be in Important. Those with lower scores might be considered Not-important unless they're key readings.\n",
      "\n",
      "So applying this:\n",
      "\n",
      "- 時間 (じかん, 5): Important\n",
      "- 分からない (わからない, 4): Important\n",
      "- 一番 (いちばん, 5): Important\n",
      "- 一*つ (ひとつ, 4): Important\n",
      "- 火星 (かせい, 3): Maybe Not-important since it's a lower score and perhaps less commonly used in daily language.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, but 火星 is the word for Mars, which might be considered important depending on context. However, if the kanji's primary reading is covered by another word, maybe this one isn't essential. But without knowing other words attached to those kanji, it's hard to say.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alternatively, perhaps all words with scores 4 and above go to Important; others go to Not-important.\n",
      "\n",
      "But then 火星 would be 3, so Not-important.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, the user example included 帝国 (score 1) as Important because it covers the main reading. So maybe the score isn't the only factor. Thus, perhaps for each word, regardless of score, if it's a primary reading, it's Important; otherwise, use the score as a tiebreaker.\n",
      "\n",
      "This is getting complicated without knowing all the primary readings. Maybe I should prioritize words with higher scores and also those that are more commonly used in daily language.\n",
      "\n",
      "Given that, I think:\n",
      "\n",
      "- 時間 (5): Important\n",
      "- 分からない (4): Important\n",
      "- 一番 (5): Important\n",
      "- 一*つ (4): Important\n",
      "- 火星 (3): Not-important\n",
      "\n",
      "But I'm not entirely confident about this. Maybe I should look up the frequency of each word.\n",
      "\n",
      "After checking, 時間 is extremely common, 分からない is very common, 一番 is also very common, and 一*つ is somewhat common but maybe less so than the others. 火星 is more specialized.\n",
      "\n",
      "Therefore, perhaps all except 火星 are Important.\n",
      "\n",
      "So in the end, I would say:\n",
      "\n",
      "Important: 時間, 分からない, 一番, 一*つ\n",

      "<think>\n",
      "Okay, I need to sort these Japanese words into two categories: Important and Not-important based on their readings and importance scores. The user provided a list of words with their kanji, readings, and scores.\n",
      "\n",
      "First, let me look at each word:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. 空 (そら, 5): This is a single kanji with the reading \"そら\" and an importance score of 5.\n",
      "2. 空港 (くうこう, 4): The kanji are 空 and 港, readings \"くうこう,\" score 4.\n",
      "3. 空気 (くうき, 5): Kanji are 空 and 気, reading \"くうき,\" score 5.\n",
      "4. 空＊いてる (あいてる, 4): The main kanji is 空 with a star, reading \"あいてる,\" score 4.\n",
      "5. 空＊ける (あける, 0): Main kanji 空 with a star, reading \"あける,\" score 0.\n",
      "\n",
      "The task is to determine which words should be learned directly after the kanji and which should be learned later. The rule says that if a word isn't useful or doesn't represent an important reading, it goes into Not-important. Also, at least one word per kanji should have an important reading.\n",
      "\n",
      "Looking at each kanji:\n",
      "\n",
      "- 空 has several readings: \"そら,\" \"くう,\" and \"あいてる\" or \"あける.\" The scores for these readings vary.\n",
      "\n",
      "Starting with the first word, 空 (そら, 5): Since it's a direct reading of the kanji and has a high score (5), this should definitely be Important.\n",
      "\n",
      "Next, 空港 (くうこう,4): This uses \"くう\" as part of its reading. The score is 4, which is still significant but not top tier. It might be useful to know this word for context, especially since it's a common term like airport. However, the importance score is lower than some others, so I'm considering whether it should be in Important or Not-important.\n",
      "\n",
      "Third, 空気 (くうき,5): This also uses \"くう\" with a high score of 5. It's an important word meaning air, which is quite fundamental. So this should definitely be Important.\n",
      "\n",
      "Fourth, 空＊いてる (あいてる,4): The reading here is \"あいてる.\" Since it's part of the kanji's readings and has a score of 4, it's somewhat important but not as crucial as those with higher scores. However, since it's a direct reading, maybe it should be Important.\n",
      "\n",
      "Lastly, 空＊ける (あける,0): This is a low importance score (0). The reading \"あける\" might be less common or useful on its own, so this could go into Not-important.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, according to the rules: For each kanji, at least one word should have an important reading. So for 空, we need at least one Important word.\n",
      "\n",
      "Looking back:\n",
      "\n",
      "- 空 (そら,5) is crucial as it's a direct and high-score reading.\n",
      "- 空港 uses \"くう,\" which is another reading but with a lower score. Since we already have そら in Important, maybe 空港 isn't necessary to include unless it's very useful.\n",
      "- 空気 (5) adds another important word with the same kanji but different reading, so including both might be good for multiple readings.\n",
      "\n",
      "For the starred words: 空＊いてる and 空＊ける. Since \"あいてる\" has a higher score (4), it's more useful than 0. But do these words need to be included? They are direct readings of the kanji with stars, but since their scores aren't as high as others, perhaps they can go into Not-important.\n",
      "\n",
      "So putting this together:\n",
      "\n",
      "Important should include 空 (そら) because it's a primary reading and high score. Also, 空港 (くうこう) might be useful for its common usage, despite the lower score. Alternatively, maybe only the highest scores should be included in Important, so perhaps 空港 is Not-important.\n",
      "\n",
      "But wait, the user said that some words are learned directly after the kanji and others later. So, if a word uses an important reading, it's better to include it as Important. The importance score can guide this: higher scores mean more importance.\n",
      "\n",
      "So:\n",
      "\n",
      "Important: 空 (そら,5), 空港 (くうこう,4), 空気 (くうき,5) because they have high scores and are direct readings. But wait, that might be too many. The user said to sort all words into two lists.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait no, the format is to list each word in either Important or Not-important. So I need to decide for each word whether it's important or not.\n",
      "\n",
      "So:\n",
      "\n",
      "空 (そら,5): Important\n",
      "\n",
      "空港 (くうこう,4): Since \"くう\" is a reading but the word itself is 4, which is less than max, maybe include it as Important because it's a useful term.\n",
      "\n",
      "空気 (くうき,5): High score and direct reading, so Important.\n",
      "\n",
      "空＊いてる (あいてる,4): Direct reading with score 4. Should this be Important? It's somewhat useful but not as high as others. Maybe Not-important?\n",
      "\n",
      "空＊ける (あけてる,0): Definitely Not-important because of low score.\n",
      "\n",
      "But the problem is that each kanji needs at least one important word to represent its main readings. So for 空, we have \"そら\" which is in Important. The other words are derivatives or less common readings, so they can be in Not-important.\n",
      "\n",
      "Therefore:\n",
      "\n",
      "Important: 空 (そら), 空港 (くうこう), 空気 (くうき)\n",
      "\n",
      "Not-important: 空＊いてる, 空＊ける\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait but I think maybe the user wants each kanji to have at least one Important word. So as long as for each kanji, one of its words is Important, others can be Not.\n",
      "\n",
      "But all these words are under the same kanji 空 except 空港 and 空気 which combine with other kanji. Wait no, no: 空港 is two kanji but the main focus is on 空. Similarly for 空気.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, perhaps we need to ensure that each unique kanji has at least one Important word. Since 空 is in all these words, as long as \"空 (そら)\" is Important, others can be Not-important if needed.\n",
      "\n",
      "But I'm a bit confused about whether the other words should also be considered for their own kanji. For example, 港 in 空港 might not have any other words here, but since it's part of this list, maybe we don't need to consider its standalone importance.\n",
      "\n",
      "In any case, following the initial assessment:\n",
      "\n",
      "Important: 空 (そら), 空港 (くうこう), 空気 (くうき)\n",
      "\n",
      "Not-important: 空＊いてる, 空＊ける\n",
      "\n",
      "But let me check the instructions again. It says that some words are learned directly after the kanji if they're useful and represent important readings.\n",
      "\n",
      "So perhaps only the most important or direct readings should be in Important, while others go to Not-important.\n",
      "\n",
      "Given that, \"空 (そら)\" is a direct reading with high score, so it's Important. The other words may not be as crucial on their own but still have some value.\n",
      "\n",
      "But according to the user’s example response, they included 空港 and 空気 in Important as well.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, no, looking at the initial problem statement: \"I am going to explain a method using this data.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, the original instruction is not entirely clear, so perhaps it's safer to include all words with high scores (5) in Important. So:\n",
      "\n",
      "Important: 空 (そら), 空気 (くうき)\n",
      "\n",
      "Not-important: 空港 (4), 空＊いてる (4), 空＊ける (0)\n",
      "\n",
      "But that might not capture all necessary words.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alternatively, perhaps the key is to include a word if it's directly tied to an important reading of the kanji. Since \"くう\" has two words: 空港 and 空気, both with 4 and 5 scores respectively. So including 空気 (5) as Important, but maybe not 空港.\n",
      "\n",
      "But I'm overcomplicating. Perhaps it's better to follow the initial assessment.\n",

      "\n",
      "First, let's list out the words again:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. 代表 (だいひょう, 2)\n",
      "2. 代＊わる (かわる, 4)\n",

      "\n",
      "The importance scores are from 0 to 5, with higher numbers indicating more importance.\n",
      "\n",
      "I need to determine which words should be learned directly after the kanji and which should be saved for later. The key points are:\n",
      "\n",
      "- Words that are useful and represent important readings should be in the \"Important\" list.\n",
      "- If a word isn't useful or doesn't show an important reading, it goes into \"Not-important.\"\n",
      "- Each kanji must have at least one important word to cover its main reading.\n",
      "\n",
      "Looking at each word:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. 代表 (だいひょう): The reading is 'daibyou' and the score is 2. This seems like a common word meaning \"representation\" or \"on behalf of.\" It's useful in formal contexts, so it's probably important.\n",
      "   \n",
      "2. 代＊わる (かわる, 4): The reading here is 'kawaru.' Wait, but I know that the correct kanji for 'kawaru' is 変える (かえる) or 変る (かわる). But in this case, it's written as 代＊わる. Maybe it's a typo or an alternative form? Regardless, the score is 4, which is quite high, so likely important.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. 代＊わり (かわり, 4): The reading 'kawari' usually relates to change or succession, like in 交代 (かくてい) meaning rotation. This word might be less common but still useful depending on context. Score is also 4, so probably important.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. 世代 (せだい, 0): Meaning \"generation,\" this word has a score of 0, which suggests it's not very important for initial learning. It can go into the non-important list.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, considering each kanji:\n",
      "\n",
      "- The first kanji is 代 in all four words. But wait, looking closer: \n",
      "\n",
      "1. 代表 uses two kanji: 代 and 表.\n",
      "2. 代＊わる uses 代 with a star next to it, possibly indicating an alternative form or maybe a different component.\n",
      "3. 代＊わり similarly uses 代 with a star.\n",
      "4. 世代 uses 代 and 世.\n",
      "\n",
      "So each of these words has its own kanji combination. However, the main focus is on whether the word itself is important enough to be learned immediately after the kanji.\n",
      "\n",
      "- 代表 (だいひょう) is definitely important because it's widely used and the reading 'daibyou' is a key on'yomi for 代.\n",
      "- 代＊わる might not be standard. I'm not sure if this is a common word or a variant. Since the score is high, maybe include it as important, but perhaps it's less crucial than others.\n",
      "- 代＊わり could be similar to 変わり (かわり), which is a useful word meaning \"change\" or \"replacement.\" However, since it's written with a star, it might not be the primary reading associated with the kanji 代. So maybe it's better to learn later.\n",
      "- 世代 (せだい) has a low score and isn't as immediately necessary.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, but each word is tied to specific kanji. For example:\n",
      "\n",
      "- 代表 includes 代 and 表. If we're focusing on learning the most important reading for each kanji in the word, then maybe 代表 teaches 代's ' dai' sound and 表's 'hyou' sound.\n",
      "\n",
      "But perhaps I'm overcomplicating. The main task is to look at each word's importance score and decide if it should be learned immediately or later based on whether it represents an important reading for its kanji.\n",
      "\n",
      "Given the scores:\n",
      "\n",
      "- 代表: Score 2, so somewhat important.\n",
      "- Both 代＊わる and 代＊わり have higher scores (4), which suggests they're more important. But wait, their readings are 'kawaru' and 'kawari.' I'm not sure how these relate to the kanji 代.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait a second, maybe there's confusion here because 代 usually has readings like ' dai' or ' kai' (as in 交代). The words given have readings starting with 'ka,' which might be related to other kanji. Maybe it's a different component or a different way of reading the same character.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alternatively, perhaps the star indicates that the word is part of an extended set beyond the basic kanji learning. In that case, maybe 代＊わる and 代＊わり are alternative readings for 代 that aren't as common, making them less important to learn immediately.\n",
      "\n",
      "So considering all this:\n",
      "\n",
      "- 代表 (だいひょう): Important, high utility.\n",
      "- 世代 (せだい): Not-important due to low score.\n",
      "\n",
      "As for the other two words with '代＊' prefix, since their scores are higher but they have stars, perhaps it's better to include them in \"Important\" if they're useful. But I'm a bit unsure because of the star notation.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alternatively, maybe the star indicates that these words are part of an extended set beyond the core kanji. In that case, they might not be as crucial for immediate learning but still have high importance scores.\n",
      "\n",
      "After considering all factors, I think 代表 and 世代 should be split based on their scores. However, since 代＊わる and 代＊わり have higher scores, they should go into Important despite the star, unless the star implies something else like a less common reading.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, but maybe the star indicates that these are not the primary readings for the kanji 代. So even though their importance score is high, since they don't represent the main reading of the kanji, they might be better learned later.\n",
      "\n",
      "In that case:\n",
      "\n",
      "Important: 代表 (daibyou) because it uses ' dai' which is a key on'yomi for 代 and also introduces 表's ' hyou.'\n",
      "\n",
      "Not-important: 代＊わる, 代＊わり, and 世代. But wait, the user said each kanji should have at least one important word for its main reading.\n",
      "\n",
      "Looking back, all four words include 代 or 世, but maybe only 代表 provides an important reading for 代 (dai). The other words might not cover the primary readings as effectively.\n",
      "\n",
      "So perhaps:\n",
      "\n",
      "Important: 代表\n",
      "\n",
      "Not-important: 世代, 代＊わる, 代＊わり\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, but that leaves three in Not-important and one in Important. But according to the user's example response, sometimes both lists can have multiple entries, but each kanji should have at least one important word.\n",
      "\n",
      "But I'm a bit confused because all four words include different combinations of kanji. Maybe I need to evaluate each word individually regardless of the kanji.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alternatively, perhaps the main focus is on whether the word itself is important, not necessarily tied to specific kanji readings beyond their inclusion in the word.\n",
      "\n",
      "Given that:\n",
      "\n",
      "- 代表 has a score of 2 (moderately important)\n",
      "- 代＊わる and 代＊わり have higher scores (4), but with stars\n",
      "- 世代 has a low score (0)\n",
      "\n",
      "I think the user wants the words that are most useful for learning important readings to be in Important, even if others can be learned later.\n",
      "\n",
      "So probably:\n",
      "\n",
      "Important: 代表, 代＊わる, 代＊わり\n",
      "\n",
      "Not-important: 世代\n",
      "\n",
      "But wait, I'm not sure about the star notation. Maybe the stars indicate that those words are part of an extended set beyond basic kanji, so they should go into Not-important despite their high scores.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alternatively, perhaps all four words are tied to different kanji components, and each needs at least one important word.\n",
      "\n",
      "But this is getting too ambiguous without more context on what the star signifies. Given that, I'll proceed by prioritizing higher scores for Important, but considering 世代's low score as Not-important.\n",

      "Alright, let me try to work through this problem step by step. The user has provided a list of Japanese words along with their readings and importance scores, and they want me to sort them into two categories: Important and Not-important.\n",
      "\n",
      "First, I need to understand the criteria for classification. The user mentions that words should be learned directly after the kanji if they are useful and represent important readings. If a word isn't useful or doesn't show an important reading, it should be learned later. Also, every kanji should have at least one important word to cover its primary reading.\n",
      "\n",
      "Looking at the given words:\n",
      "1. 惑*う (まどう, 2)\n",
      "2. 迷惑 (めいわく, 3)\n",
      "\n",
      "I notice that both are associated with the same kanji: 惑. Wait, no, actually, 迷惑 is a compound of two kanji: 迷 and 惑. So maybe I'm misunderstanding. Let me clarify.\n",
      "\n",
      "Each word provided has a certain kanji, but in this case, \"惑*う\" uses the kanji 惑, while 迷惑 uses 迷 and 惑. But perhaps the user is considering each word's main kanji. Wait, no—the user says all words contain a certain kanji, so maybe each word corresponds to one specific kanji.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, looking back at the example in the query: \"一*つ (ひとつ, 4)\"—the user includes a star next to the kanji. So perhaps in the provided list, 惑*う means that the primary kanji is 惑, and 迷惑 might be considered as one word but uses two kanji.\n",
      "\n",
      "But since the task is to sort the words based on their importance for learning the kanji's readings, I think each word should be evaluated individually. So \"惑*う\" has the reading まどう and an importance score of 2, while 迷惑 has 道わく (I think it's meiwaku) with a score of 3.\n",
      "\n",
      "The importance scores go from 0 to 5, so higher numbers are more important. The user wants me to judge which words should be learned immediately after the kanji and which can be delayed.\n",
      "\n",
      "For \"惑*う,\" the reading is まどう, which means 'to wander' or 'be confused.' It's a useful verb in Japanese, so it might be considered important for learning the kanji 惑. The score is 2, which isn't very high but still moderate.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then there's 迷惑 (めいわく), meaning 'trouble' or 'inconvenience,' with a higher importance score of 3. This word is quite common and useful in daily language, so it's definitely important for learning the kanji 迷 and 惑 as part of this compound.\n",
      "\n",
      "But wait, each word corresponds to one kanji? Or does each word have multiple kanji? Since 迷惑 uses two kanji, but perhaps the user wants each word to be evaluated based on its own importance regardless of the number of kanji it contains.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, the initial instruction says: \"All words may be classified as important. But for less important kanji, it is acceptable to have less important words. Although at least one word should always be important to learn the most important reading of the word.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "So each word is tied to a specific kanji. So 惑*う is linked to the kanji 惑, and 迷惑 is linked to both 迷 and 惑? Or perhaps each word is only linked to one kanji for learning purposes.\n",
      "\n",
      "I think I might be overcomplicating it. The user wants me to sort the provided words into Important and Not-important based on whether they are useful and represent important readings for their respective kanji.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, \"惑*う\" has an importance score of 2. Since it's a verb form with a moderate score, it might be considered important but not top priority. 迷惑 has a higher score (3) and is a commonly used word, so it should definitely be in the Important list.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, but each kanji needs at least one important word to cover its primary reading. So if 惑*う is the only word for 惑, then it's necessary to include it as important because without it, we wouldn't learn the main reading of 惙. But since 迷惑 also uses 惙 and has a higher score, perhaps both should be considered.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait no, \"惑*う\" is 惙 with a star, meaning that's the primary kanji to focus on for this word. So \"惑*う\" (まどう) is important because it teaches the reading まどう for 惙. Without it, we wouldn't learn that reading.\n",
      "\n",
      "But then 迷惑 also uses 惙 as part of its compound, but since it's a separate word, maybe it's better to include both in the Important list because they each teach different readings of their respective kanji.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, no—each word is associated with one kanji. So \"惑*う\" is for 惙, and 迷惑 might be for another kanji, perhaps 迷? Or does it also involve 惙?\n",
      "\n",
      "I'm getting confused here. Let me try to clarify: each word corresponds to a certain kanji, as per the user's instruction. So when the user provides \"惑*う,\" that means the primary kanji is 惙, and the word teaches its reading.\n",
      "\n",
      "Therefore, for the kanji 惙, we have two words: 惑*う (まどう) with a score of 2, and 迷惑 (めいわく) which also uses 惙 but as part of another compound. But since each word is tied to one kanji, perhaps 迷惑 is linked to the kanji 迷.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, I'm getting stuck here. Maybe it's better to approach this by considering that each word is a separate entity and should be evaluated based on its own importance regardless of other words.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, \"惑*う\" (まどう) has an importance score of 2—moderate. It teaches the reading まどう for 惙, which is a useful verb. So it's important to include this word as important because it directly represents the kanji and its primary reading.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then, 迷惑 (めいわく) has a higher score of 3. This word is quite common in Japanese, meaning 'inconvenience' or 'trouble.' It's definitely an important word for learning both 迷 and 惙. However, since the task is to sort each word into categories based on their own importance, not their kanji.\n",
      "\n",
      "But wait, the user wants me to return the kanji of the word in the lists. So if a word is classified as Important, I list its kanji; same for Not-important.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait no, looking back at the example: \"一*つ (いちばん, 4)\" would be returned as 一*つ in the important list. So each word's representation includes the kanji and reading, but the classification is based on whether it's an important word to learn after its kanji.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, considering that, I need to decide which words are essential for learning their respective kanji's important readings.\n",
      "\n",
      "For \"惑*う,\" since it has a score of 2 and is a verb with a useful meaning, it should be considered important. It teaches the primary reading of 惙 as まどう.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then, 迷惑 (めいわく) with a score of 3 is even more important and widely used. It uses both 迷 and 惙, but since each word is linked to a specific kanji, perhaps it's tied to one of them. However, the user hasn't specified which kanji each word corresponds to beyond the star notation.\n",
      "\n",
      "Given that, I think \"惑*う\" should be in Important because it directly teaches the reading for 惙, and 迷惑, being a high-scored and common word, also goes into Important.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alternatively, if we consider that both words are tied to different kanji (e.g., 迷惑 might be linked to 迷), but since the user only marked \"惑*う\" with a star, perhaps only that is for 惙. Therefore, including both in Important makes sense as they each contribute to learning their respective kanji.\n",
      "\n",
      "But I'm not entirely sure. Maybe it's safer to include both in Important since they have higher scores and are useful words.\n",

      "\n",
      "First, I should understand what each word means and why they're being sorted this way. The goal is to create flashcards where some words are learned directly after the kanji because they're useful or represent important readings, while others are saved for later.\n",
      "\n",
      "Looking at 怪我 (けが, 1), it's a noun meaning 'injury' or 'harm.' The reading is けが, which is a basic and common way to read that kanji. Since the importance score is 1, which seems lower, maybe this isn't the most critical word for learning the kanji.\n",
      "\n",
      "Next, 我 (われ, 4) is an archaic or literary term meaning 'I' or 'myself.' It's not commonly used in modern Japanese but still appears in certain contexts. The reading is われ, and it has a higher importance score of 4, so this might be considered important to learn the kanji.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then there's 我＊われ (われわれ, 4), which is a compound using the same kanji twice. This word means 'we' in a humble context or when referring to oneself and one's companions. It has a similar importance score of 4 but uses two 我 kanjies. Since it's also important, maybe this should be included as well.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, considering the rules: words learned directly after the kanji should only be useful and represent important readings. The most important reading for each kanji should have at least one word associated with it. \n",
      "\n",
      "For 怪我 (けが), even though its importance score is 1, it's a common word that represents the primary reading of the kanji. So learning 怪我 early makes sense because it's widely used and teaches the fundamental reading.\n",
      "\n",
      "For 我 (われ) and 我＊われ (われわれ), both have higher scores and are important readings for the kanji. However, since 我 is a single kanji and appears in both words, maybe prioritizing 我 first would be better to learn the basic form before moving on to compound forms like 我＊われ.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, I think 怪我 should be considered important because it's a common word with a lower score but essential for the reading. Both 我 and 我＊われ are also important due to their higher scores and relevance. Therefore, all three might fall under the important category since each contributes to understanding different aspects of the kanji.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, but the user mentioned that for less important kanji, it's acceptable to have less important words. However, 怪我 is a common word, so even with a lower score, it's still useful.

      "\n",
      "First, looking at the words:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. 戦＊う (たたかう, 4)\n",
      "2. 挑戦 (ちょうせん, 3)\n",
      "3. 戦争 (せんそう, 5)\n",
      "4. 戦＊い (たtatかい, 4)\n",
      "\n",
      "The importance scores range from 3 to 5, with the highest being 5 for 戦争.\n",
      "\n",
      "I know that in Japanese education, certain words are prioritized because they teach important readings of a kanji. So, the key here is to determine which words are essential for understanding the main readings of their respective kanji.\n",
      "\n",
      "Starting with 戦＊う (たたかう): This word means \"to fight\" or \"to battle.\" The reading たたかう is one of the primary ways this kanji is used. Since it's a common verb and has a high importance score (4), it should probably be considered important.\n",
      "\n",
      "Next, 挑戦 (ちょうせん): This word means \"challenge\" and uses two kanji: 挑 and 戦. The reading for the entire compound is ちょうせん, but I'm focusing on which kanji's main readings are being taught here. Since the primary focus is on the kanji 戦, its reading in this context is せん (from ちょうせん). However, the score here is lower at 3, so maybe it's less critical than others.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then, 戦争 (せんそう, 5): This word means \"war\" and is another primary way to read the kanji 戦 as せん. Since this has the highest importance score of 5, it's definitely an important word for learning a key reading of the kanji.\n",
      "\n",
      "Lastly, 戦＊い (たtatかい, 4): This seems like a compound where the second part is たかい. I'm not entirely sure about the exact meaning, but it likely refers to something related to fighting or battle. The score is 4, so it's important, but perhaps secondary to others.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, considering that each kanji should have at least one important word to teach its main reading. For 戦, the primary readings are せん and たたかう. So, 戦争 (せんそう) teaches せん, which is a crucial reading, making it highly important. Similarly, 戦＊う (たtatかう) teaches たtatかう, which is another essential reading.\n",
      "\n",
      "挑戦 (ちょうせん) uses the せん reading but adds another kanji, so it's less critical for just learning the basic readings of 戦 on its own. It might be better to learn later once the primary readings are mastered.\n",
      "\n",
      "The word 戦＊い (たtatかい) also uses たtat reading, which is similar to たtatかう but perhaps a bit more advanced or less common. Given that it has a high score, I'm a bit torn, but since たtatかう is more fundamental and appears in a simpler word, maybe 戦＊い should be considered not important for the initial learning phase.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, putting this together:\n",
      "\n",
      "Important: 戦＊う (taattekau), 挑戦 (ちょうせん), 戦争 (senso)\n",
      "Not-important: 戦＊い (tatかい)\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, but I think I might have made a mistake. The user wants the words to be sorted as either important or not based on whether they're useful for learning the main readings of the kanji. Since all these words contain some form of 戦, perhaps only those that teach the most fundamental readings should be in the important list.\n",
      "\n",
      "Actually, reconsidering:挑戦 (ちょうせん) uses せん, which is a primary reading taught by 戦争 (senso). So maybe 挑戦 isn't as crucial because it's using the same せん reading that's already covered by 戦争. Therefore, it might be better to prioritize the words that cover different readings or are more fundamental.\n",
      "\n",
      "But wait, no—each word contributes a reading of its kanji. The main point is whether each kanji has at least one important word teaching an essential reading. Since both 戦＊う and 戦争 teach たtat and せん respectively, which are key readings, they should be in the important list.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, I think the correct categorization would be:\n",
      "\n",
      "Important: 戦＊う (taattekau), 挑戦 (ちょうせん), 戦争 (senso)\n",
      "Not-important: 戦＊い (tatかい)\n",
      "\n",
      "But wait, that can't be right because all four words are listed, and I need to split them into important and not. Let me think again.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alternatively, perhaps only the top two or three should be important. Given their scores:\n",
      "\n",
      "- 4 points: 戦＊う and 戦＊い\n",
      "- 3 points: 挑戦\n",
      "- 5 points: 戦争 (highest)\n",
      "\n",
      "Since the user wants to learn directly after kanji only words that are useful and represent important readings, I should prioritize those with higher scores. Therefore:\n",
      "\n",
      "Important: 戦争 (せんそう) is a must because of its high score and teaching a key reading.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then, 戦＊う (たtatかう) is also important as it's a fundamental verb meaning \"to fight.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "挑戦 (ちょうせん) uses the せん reading but combines with another kanji, so maybe it's better to learn later.\n",
      "\n",
      "Similarly, 戦＊い (tatかい) might be less essential than the other two.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, but I'm confused. Let me check each word:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. 戦＊う: たtatかう (4) – a verb meaning \"to fight.\" Important for the reading たtatかう.\n",
      "2. 挑戦: ちょうせん (3) – \"challenge,\" using せん from 戦.\n",
      "3. 戦争: せんそう (5) – \"war,\" primary reading せん.\n",
      "4. 戦＊い: tatかい (4) – maybe a noun meaning \"fight\" or similar.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, considering that both 戦＊う and 戦争 teach the main readings of the kanji, they should be important.挑戦 is also using せん but with another kanji, so perhaps it's better to learn later. Similarly, 戦＊い might not be as crucial if we're focusing on the primary readings first.\n",
      "\n",
      "So the final categorization would be:\n",
      "\n",
      "Important: 戦＊う (taattekau), 挑戦 (ちょうせん), 戦争 (senso)\n",
      "Not-important: 戦＊い (tatかい)\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, but that leaves me with three important and one not. Alternatively, maybe only two are important because of the kanji's main readings.\n",
      "\n",
      "Actually, I think the correct approach is to select the words that best represent the primary readings for each kanji involved. Since all four contain variations of 戦, perhaps we should focus on those that have unique or essential readings.\n",
      "\n",
      "But I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let me try a different angle: for each word, determine if it's essential for teaching an important reading.\n",
      "\n",
      "- 戦＊う (4): teaches たtatかう – important.\n",
      "- 挑戦 (3): teaches せん but with another kanji.\n",
      "- 戦争 (5): teaches せん and is highly scored.\n",
      "- 戦＊い (4): might be a less common form of the same reading as 戦＊う.\n",
      "\n",
      "Given that, perhaps only 戦＊う and 戦争 are essential. Then, 挑戦 could be considered not important because it's supplementary, and 戦＊い is another form but maybe not as critical.\n",
      "\n",
      "But I'm not entirely sure. Maybe I should prioritize the highest-scoring words first.\n",
      "\n",
      "So:\n",
      "\n",
      "Important: 戦争 (5), 戦＊う (4)\n",
      "Not-important: 挑戈 (3), 戦＊い (4)\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, but that would be two important and two not, which seems balanced.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alternatively, perhaps all except one are important. I think the key is to include those with higher scores and more fundamental readings. So:\n",
      "\n",
      "Important: 戦＊う (taattekau), 挑戦 (ちょうせん), 戰争 (senso)\n",
      "Not-important: 戦＊い (tatかい)\n",
      "\n",
      "But then that's three important, one not.\n",
      "\n",
      "I think I've spent too much time on this, and perhaps the initial split is correct. So the final answer would be:\n",
      "\n",
      "Important: 戦＊う (taattekau), 挑戦 (ちょうせん), 戦争 (senso)\n",

The goal is to create flashcards where some words are learned immediately after the kanji if they're useful or represent an important reading, while others are learned later.\n",
      "\n",
      "First, I need to understand the key points here. Each word has a kanji, a reading, and an importance score. The user wants me to separate these into two lists: Important and Not-important. The important list should include words that are useful or have significant readings, especially if they help in learning the primary reading of the kanji.\n",
      "\n",
      "I remember the example provided was for the word 一*つ (ひとつ, 4), which was placed in the Important list because it's a common on'yomi and helps learners grasp the primary reading early. So, I should prioritize words that either have high importance scores or are essential for understanding the main readings of their kanji.\n",
      "\n",
      "Looking at the sample data given, like 大臣 (だいじん, 1), even though the score is low, it might still be important because it's a significant term in Japanese. However, without more context on each word's utility, I have to rely on the scores and my judgment about their significance.\n",
      "\n",
      "I should consider factors beyond just the numerical score—like how often the word is used or whether it's a common kanji with multiple readings. If a word is the primary way to learn a crucial reading for a kanji, even a lower score might push it into the Important list. Conversely, if the word isn't commonly used and doesn’t help much in learning the main reading, it can go into Not-important.\n",
      "\n",
      "I also need to ensure that each kanji has at least one important word associated with it to cover its primary reading, as per the user's instruction. So even if a word has a low score but is essential for the main reading, it should be prioritized.\n",
      "\n",
      "In summary, my approach will be:\n",
      "1. Evaluate each word based on its importance score and practicality.\n",
      "2. Check if it represents an important or common reading of its kanji.\n",
      "3. Assign it to Important if it's useful for learning the primary reading or has a high score; otherwise, Not-important.\n",
      "\n",
      "I need to make sure I respond strictly with the two lists as specified, using the exact word forms provided, including any special characters like * or ＊. No explanations or additional text—just the categorized words.\n",

      "Okay, so I'm trying to help sort these Japanese words into important and not-important categories based on their readings and importance scores. The user has provided a list of words with their readings and scores, and I need to decide which ones should be learned directly after the kanji (important) and which can be learned later (not-important). \n",
      "\n",
      "First, let me look at each word individually.\n",
      "\n",
      "1. 放＊れる (はなれる, 3): The kanji here is 放 with the reading \"はな\". This seems like a common verb form, so it's probably useful. The importance score is 3, which isn't too low but not super high either. However, since it's directly after the kanji, I should consider if this represents an important reading.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. 放＊す (はなす, 3): Again, the same kanji 放 with \"はな\" as a reading. The word is \"はなす,\" which I think means to abandon or discard. Since it's also scored at 3, similar to the first one, but perhaps this is more commonly used than the other.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. 食べ放題 (たべほうだい, 4): This one combines two kanji: 食べ (食) and 放題 (放). The reading for 放 here is \"ほう,\" which I know is another common reading. The word itself refers to all-you-can-eat or a buffet style, which is pretty useful in real-life contexts.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. 放送 (ほうそう, 4): Another word with 放 and 送. This one means broadcasting or transmission. It's definitely important because it's used in media and technology contexts, which are quite common.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. 飲み放題 (のみほうだい, 4): Similar structure to 食べ放題 but with 飲 (drink). Again, \"ほうだい\" is part of the reading for 放, so this word is useful in situations like drinking establishments offering all-you-can-drink.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. 解放 (かいほう, 3): The kanji here are 解 and 放. I know that 解放 means liberation or release, which is a significant term, especially in historical contexts. It's also a higher-level vocabulary, so it might be more important.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, considering the task: words learned directly after the kanji should only be those that are useful and represent important readings. So for each kanji, I need to pick the most useful or representative word.\n",
      "\n",
      "Looking at 放: The readings include はな (from 1 and 2), ほう (from 3,4,5). Both はな and ほう are important readings for 放. However, はな is more common in verbs like はなす, whereas ほう is used in compound terms like 放送 and 食べ放題.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, perhaps choosing the word that uses \"ほう\" would be better because it's a more versatile reading in compounds, which are often more frequently encountered. Therefore, 放＊れる and 放＊す might not be as essential as the others since they use はな, but they still have their own importance.\n",
      "\n",
      "Considering the scores: All words except maybe 1 and 2 have higher scores (4), so those should definitely be important. However, the user mentioned that at least one word per kanji should be important to cover the main reading.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, each of these words actually uses a different kanji or combines with others. Let me clarify:\n",
      "\n",
      "- 放＊れる and 放＊す both focus on the reading はな for 放.\n",
      "- 食べ放題, 飲み放題 use ほう for 放 in compounds.\n",
      "- 放送 also uses ほう.\n",
      "- 解放 uses かいほう, where 放 is part of the compound.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, perhaps it's better to prioritize words that show both kanji readings. For example, 食べ放題 and 飲み放題 use ほう, which is a key reading for 放 in compounds. Similarly, 放送 uses ほう as well. 解放 uses かいほう, so that shows another aspect of the kanji.\n",
      "\n",
      "But I need to decide which words should be learned immediately after the kanji. The ones that are most useful and represent important readings. So maybe 食べ放題 and 飲み放題 are good because they show how 放 is used in common phrases like 'all-you-can-eat' or 'all-you-can-drink.' Similarly, 放送 is a key term in media.\n",
      "\n",
      "On the other hand, 放＊す (はなす) and 放＊れる (はなれる) are more about the はな reading, which might be less commonly used compared to ほう. However, they're still important for understanding verb forms.\n",
      "\n",
      "解放 (かいほう) is a significant word in terms of vocabulary but might be more advanced. It's scored at 3, so perhaps it's not as crucial as others with higher scores.\n",
      "\n",
      "So putting this together:\n",
      "\n",
      "Important: 放＊れる, 食べ放題, 放送, 飲み放題, 解放\n",
      "Not-important: 放＊す\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, but the user wants two lists. So I need to split them into important and not-important based on whether they're learned directly after kanji or later.\n",
      "\n",
      "But perhaps it's better to choose the most important ones first. Since each kanji might have multiple readings, we should pick the one that best represents its primary reading.\n",
      "\n",
      "Looking again:\n",
      "\n",
      "- 放＊れる (はなれる) is a potential reading but maybe less common than ほう.\n",
      "- 食べ放題 and 飲み放題 are both important because they use ほう in a compound and are high-frequency terms.\n",
      "- 放送 is also crucial for media-related vocabulary.\n",
      "\n",
      "So maybe the important list should include 食べ放題, 放送, 飲み放題, and 解放. The others can be not-important. But let me double-check.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alternatively, since each word uses a different kanji or part of it:\n",
      "\n",
      "- 放＊れる is about はな.\n",
      "- 食べ放題 uses ほう in the second kanji.\n",
      "- 放送 also uses ほう.\n",
      "- 飲み放題 same as above.\n",
      "- 解放 uses かいほう.\n",
      "\n",
      "So perhaps, for each kanji, I need to pick one word. But wait, some words combine two kanji (like 食べ放題 has both 食 and 放). So maybe it's better to consider which words best represent the key readings of their respective kanji.\n",
      "\n",
      "In that case:\n",
      "\n",
      "- For 放: The important reading is ほう, so 食べ放題, 放送, and 飲み放題 all use this. However, since they're compound words, maybe one can be selected as important, but the user's instruction was to sort all given words into two lists.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, I think I need to go back to the initial approach. The user wants me to categorize each provided word as important or not based on whether it should be learned immediately after the kanji (important) or later (not-important). So for each word in the list, decide if it's important enough to learn right away.\n",
      "\n",
      "Given that:\n",
      "\n",
      "- 放＊れる: 3\n",
      "- 放＊す: 3\n",
      "- 食べ放題:4\n",
      "- 放送:4\n",
      "- 飲み放題:4\n",
      "- 解放:3\n",
      "\n",
      "I think the ones with higher scores (4) are more important, so those should be in the important list. The ones with lower scores (3) can be not-important, but considering that解放 is also 3 and it's a significant word, perhaps it's better to include it as important.\n",
      "\n",
      "But wait, no—higher score means more importance. So 4s are more important than 3s.\n",
      "\n",
      "So:\n",
      "\n",
      "Important: 食べ放題, 放送, 飲み放題 (all 4)\n",
      "Not-important: 放＊れる, 放＊す, 解放 (all 3 or lower)\n",
      "\n",
      "But the user's instruction was to go through all the given words and categorize them as important or not.\n",
      "\n",
      "So I think:\n",
      "\n",
      "Important should include the ones with higher scores because they are more critical. Therefore, 食べ放題, 放送, 飲み放題 (all 4) are important. The others can be not-important.\n",
      "\n",
      "But 解放 is a significant word; maybe it's better to include it as well. However, since its score is lower (3), perhaps it's more appropriate to place it in the not-important list.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alternatively, if we consider that all words should be categorized regardless of their scores, focusing on whether they represent key readings or usages.\n",
      "\n",
      "In that case:\n",
      "\n",
      "- 放＊す and 放＊れる focus on the はな reading, which might be less common compared to ほう, so they could be not-important.\n",
      "- 食べ放題, 放送, 飲み放題 use ほう in compounds, making them important.\n",
      "- 解放 uses かいほう, which is another key reading for the kanji.\n",
      "\n",
      "But since it's a single word, perhaps 解放 can be considered as an important one as well because it's a significant term.\n",
      "\n",
      "So maybe:\n",
      "\n",
      "Important: 食べ放題, 放送, 飲み放題, 解放\n",
      "Not-important: 放＊れる, 放＊す\n",
      "\n",
      "That way, all the 4s and解放 (3) are in important, while the lower ones (3) that aren't as crucial go to not-important.\n",
      "\n",
      "But I'm a bit torn because 解放 is scored at 3, which might mean it's less critical than others. However, it's still a significant word.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alternatively, perhaps all the words with score 4 are important, and the rest go to not-important.\n",
      "\n",
      "So:\n",
      "\n",
      "Important: 食べ放題, 放送, 飲み放題\n",
      "Not-important: 放＊れる, 放＊す, 解放\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "First, I need to understand what makes a word \"important\" in this context. The user mentioned that the important words are those that are useful or represent important readings for their kanji. Also, each kanji should have at least one important word to learn its most crucial reading. But if a kanji isn't very important (like with a low score), it's okay to have fewer important words associated with it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Looking at the given example: 滴＊る (したたる, 1). The importance score is 1 out of 5, which is pretty low. Now, I need to decide if this word should be considered important or not.\n",
      "\n",
      "The word itself is 滴＊る, which I know means 'to drip' in Japanese. The reading given is したたる. Since the kanji here seems to be a single one (滴), but there's a * symbol indicating maybe another kanji? Or perhaps it's a way to denote that the entire word includes a specific kanji.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, no, looking again, the user specified that all words contain a certain kanji. So each word is associated with a particular kanji. In this case, 滴＊る probably contains the kanji 滴 (しき) which means 'to drop' or 'drip'. The reading for that kanji alone would be しき, but the entire word here has したたる as its reading.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, evaluating importance: the score is 1. Since it's low, maybe this isn't a high priority word. But I have to consider if it represents an important reading for the kanji 滴. The main reading for 滴 is usually しき, but in this case, the entire word has したたる as its reading.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, perhaps the word is 滴る (しずる) or したたる? I'm a bit confused because 滴る would be しずる, but したたる might be another form. Maybe it's a compound where 滴 has an additional kanji, hence the * in the word.\n",
      "\n",
      "In any case, since the importance score is low (1), and considering that other words with higher scores should take priority, this one might be classified as not important. Plus, if there are other words linked to the same kanji with higher scores, those would be prioritized first.\n",

In this case, the word provided uses \"tsu(mu)\" as in 摸む (つむ), which typically means \"to touch\" or \"to handle.\" However, another common reading is \"fu\" as in 摸る (fu(ru)), meaning to feel one's way. \n",

Since the score is 2, which is lower than the midpoint (which would be around 3), it suggests that this word isn't as crucial.\n",

I know that 返 means \"to return\" or \"reply.\" 返事 specifically means \"reply\" or \"response,\" which seems like a common word. The importance score is 4 out of 5, so it's pretty high. This word likely represents an important use of the kanji.\n",
      "\n",
      "Next, 返＊る (かえる, 3). The reading is かえる, which I recognize as the verb \"to return\" or \"come back.\" It's a highly common verb in Japanese. However, the importance score here is 3, which is lower than the other two. But since it's such a fundamental verb and an important use of the kanji, even with a lower score, it should probably be considered important.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then, 返*す (かえす, 5). The reading is かえす, meaning \"to return\" or \"give back.\" This is also a common verb. The importance score is 5, which is the highest among them. Since it's another core usage of the kanji, this should definitely be important.\n",

      "Now, considering the user's criteria: words learned directly after the kanji should only be those that are useful and represent important readings.

      "\n",
      "I think all three words should be considered important because each represents a different but significant use of the kanji 返. But given their scores, the two with higher scores (返事 and 返*す) are definitely important. The one with the lower score (返＊る) might still be important due to its common usage despite the lower score.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, the user mentioned that for less important kanji, it's acceptable to have less important words, but at least one word should always be important. So perhaps I need to choose only those that are most essential.\n",
      "\n",
      "Given that 返*す has a higher score (5) and is a core verb, it definitely belongs in the important list. 返事 also is high (4), so it's important too. However, maybe 返＊る can be considered not as crucial because of its lower score, but since かえる is a fundamental verb, it might still be important.\n",
      "\n",

      "Okay, let me try to figure out how to sort these words based on the user's instructions. The task is to separate the provided Japanese words into two lists: Important and Not-important. \n",
      "\n",
      "First, I need to understand the criteria. The user says that some words should be learned directly after the kanji if they're useful or represent important readings. Others can be learned later. So, I have to determine which words are essential for learning the main readings of their respective kanji.\n",
      "\n",
      "Looking at the given words:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. 絶滅 (ぜつめつ, 0)\n",
      "2. 滅＊びる (ほろびる, 0)\n",
      "3. 滅＊ぼす (ほろぼす, 3)\n",
      "4. 撥滅 (ぼくめつ, 0)\n",
      "\n",
      "Each word has a kanji and its reading along with an importance score from 0 to 5.\n",
      "\n",
      "Starting with 絶滅 (ぜつめつ). The kanji here is 絶, which means 'to cut off' or 'extinct'. The reading is ぜつめつ, which means 'extinction' or 'extermination'. Since the importance score is 0, it might not be as crucial, but I should check if this is a primary reading for the kanji 絶. If so, it's important to learn this word early.\n",
      "\n",
      "Next, 滅＊びる (ほろびる). The kanji here seems to be 滅 with two readings: ほろびる and ほろぼす. This is a bit confusing because the same kanji can have multiple readings. For 滅＊びる, the reading is ほろびる, which I think means 'to perish' or 'to die out'. The importance score is 0 here as well.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then we have 滅＊ぼす (ほろぼす, 3). This has a higher importance score of 3. The reading is ほろぼす, which I believe means 'to destroy' or 'to annihilate'. Since the score is 3, this might be more important than the previous one.\n",
      "\n",
      "Lastly, 撥滅 (ぼくめつ, 0). The kanji here is 撫, but wait, that doesn't seem right. Wait, no, 撈 is 撫 in Japanese? Hmm, perhaps it's 撪? Let me check. Oh, the user wrote 撥滅 as ぼくめつ. I think 撮 is 'to take' or 'pluck', but combined with 灭 (me), maybe it means something like 'extermination'. However, the kanji might be more complicated here.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, no, actually, looking at the word: 撥滅. The first kanji is 撫, which I think is 'to pat' or 'to stroke', but that doesn't make sense with 灭 (me). Maybe it's a different kanji? Or perhaps a typo? Alternatively, maybe it's 捕 (to catch) plus 灭? Hmm, this could be confusing. But since the user provided it as 撥滅, I'll take it as is.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, considering each word:\n",
      "\n",
      "- For 絶, ぜつめつの重要性。Since it's a direct reading of 絶, and the score is 0, maybe it's not as critical, but it's still useful. However, since all kanji should have at least one important word, I need to check if any of these words are essential for their kanji.\n",
      "\n",
      "Looking at 滅＊びる (ほろびる). The kanji 滅 has two readings here: ほろびる and ほろぼす. Since both readings share the same kanji, perhaps the more common or important reading is ほろぼす with a higher score of 3, while ほろびる might be less commonly used. Therefore, ほろびる could be considered not as important.\n",
      "\n",
      "Similarly, 撥滅 (ぼくめつ) has an importance score of 0. If this kanji isn't commonly used, maybe the word is less important.\n",
      "\n",
      "Putting it all together:\n",
      "\n",
      "- 絶滅 (ぜつめつ): Since it's a direct reading for 絶 and the kanji might not have another more important word, perhaps this is important.\n",
      "- 滅＊びる: Lower importance score of 0 and maybe less common compared to ほろぼす.\n",
      "- 滅＊ぼす: Higher importance score (3), so it should be in Important.\n",
      "- 撥滅: Low score (0) and possibly less critical.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, but the user said that for each kanji, at least one word must be important. So I need to ensure that each unique kanji has at least one important word.\n",
      "\n",
      "Looking back:\n",
      "\n",
      "- 絶 is used in 絶滅.\n",
      "- 滅 is used in both 滅＊びる and 滅＊ぼす.\n",
      "- 撥 (or 撫) is used in 撰滅.\n",
      "\n",
      "So for each kanji, at least one word should be important.\n",
      "\n",
      "In this case:\n",
      "\n",
      "- For 絶: 絶inction is a direct reading. Since the score is 0, but it's essential to know the main meaning, maybe it's still important.\n",
      "- For 滅: Between ほろびる and ほろぼす, since ほろぼす has a higher score (3), that should be considered important, while ほろびる can be not-important.\n",
      "- For 撫 (or whatever kanji is used in 撥滅): The word's importance is 0, but the kanji might need at least one important word. However, since the score is low and perhaps this kanji isn't as common, maybe it's acceptable to have only this word, even with a 0.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, but the user said that if all words are classified as important, that's fine, but for less important kanji, it's okay to have fewer. But each kanji must have at least one important word if possible. So in this case:\n",
      "\n",
      "- 絶: 絶inction is 0. Maybe it should still be considered because it's a primary reading.\n",
      "- 滅: We can mark ほろぼす as important, which covers the main reading.\n",
      "- 撫 (or 撥): Since its only word has a score of 0, maybe it's acceptable to have that as not-important.\n",
      "\n",
      "But wait, in the user's example response, they included 絶＊めつ in Important and others in Not-important. So perhaps 絶 extinction is important because it's the main reading for 絶. \n",
      "\n",
      "So finalizing:\n",
      "\n",
      "Important: 絶＊めつ (滅 is part of the word, but wait, no—each entry is a separate word with their own kanji. Wait, each line is a separate word with its own kanji.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, looking at the user's example response, they used the same format as the input words, meaning that each entry is a separate word. So in my case, I need to assign each of these four words into Important or Not-important.\n",
      "\n",
      "But perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think again:\n",
      "\n",
      "Each word has its own kanji, but some share the same kanji. For example, 滅＊びる and 滅＊ぼす both use 满 (if that's correct). So the user is providing words with their readings and importance scores.\n",
      "\n",
      "The task is to decide which of these four words are important to learn directly after their respective kanji and which can be learned later.\n",
      "\n",
      "So for each word, if it represents an important reading or is useful, it goes into Important. Otherwise, Not-important.\n",
      "\n",
      "Given that:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. 絶＊めつ (滅? Or 絶 with 滁? Wait, the user's original input was \"滅\", but in my case, I think each line is a word with its own kanji(s). So perhaps for clarity, it's better to treat each entry separately.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, considering each word:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. 絶＊めつ: If this means 'extinction' and has a score of 0, but since it's the primary meaning of 絶, maybe it should be considered important.\n",
      "2. 滅＊びる: Score 0. Maybe less important compared to other readings.\n",
      "3. 滅＊ぼす: Score 3. Definitely important as it's a more common and higher value reading.\n",
      "4. 撮＊めつ: Score 0, perhaps less important.\n",
      "\n",
      "So Important would include 絶＊めつ (if it's the primary reading), 滅＊ぼす. Not-important would be 滅＊びる and 撮＊めつ.\n",
      "\n",
      "But wait, in the user's example response, they had \"重要：滅＊めつ\" but perhaps that was a different scenario. In any case, I think for my own reasoning:\n",
      "\n",
      "- 絶＊めつ: Important as primary meaning.\n",
      "- 滅＊びる: Not-important due to lower score and possibly less common.\n",
      "- 滅＊ぼす: Important because of higher score.\n",
      "- 撮＊滅: Not-important.\n",

      "\n",
      "For example, if a word has a high score like 5, it's definitely important. Scores around 3-4 are medium and could go either way depending on utility. Lower scores (1-2) might be less likely to be important unless the word is very common.\n",

      "I also need to pay attention to whether the word represents an important reading of the kanji. Sometimes a kanji can have multiple readings, but only one or two are commonly used or important.\n",

      "Alright, let's tackle this query step by step. The user has provided a list of Japanese words along with their readings and importance scores. My task is to sort them into two categories: Important and Not-important based on specific criteria.\n",
      "\n",
      "First, I need to understand the user's objective. They want to create flashcards for kanji and words, but some words should be learned immediately after the kanji, while others can wait. The key here is that the important words are those that are useful or represent significant readings of the kanji. If a word isn't useful or doesn't capture an essential reading, it goes into the Not-important list.\n",
      "\n",
      "Looking at the provided word: 遗憾! (いかん!, 1). The importance score is 1 out of 5. Now, I should assess whether this word is important enough to be learned right after the kanji. \n",
      "\n",
      "\"遺憾\" means \"regret\" or \"lament,\" and its reading \"ikkan\" is a less common or more nuanced term. In Japanese, \"han\" (恨) is a more frequently used kanji for similar meanings. Given that it's scored as 1, which is quite low, it might not be the most essential word to learn immediately.\n",
      "\n",
      "I should consider if there are other words with the same kanji that are more important or have higher readings. Since 遗憾! has a lower importance score and isn't a commonly used term, it makes sense to categorize it as Not-important. This way, the user can prioritize learning other words first before tackling this one later.\n",
      "\n",
      "I also need to ensure that at least one word with the most important reading is learned immediately if possible. However, in this case, since \"遗\" has another common reading like \"い\" (as in 遗留 or 遺伝), but the provided word doesn't showcase that. But since the user only gave me this word for sorting, I have to work with what's provided.\n",
      "\n",
      "In conclusion, 遗憾! should go into Not-important because it's less useful and has a low importance score.\n",

      "\n",
      "First, I need to understand the criteria for determining whether a word is important or not.

      "<think>\n",
      "Okay, I'm looking at this problem where I need to sort some Japanese words into two categories: Important and Not-important based on their readings and importance scores. The user provided a list of three entries all related to the kanji 裏 (urashi). \n",
      "\n",
      "First, let me break down each entry:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. 裏本 (うらぼん, 0): This word has an importance score of 0.\n",
      "2. 裏 (うら, 3): This is a single kanji with a reading and an importance score of 3.\n",
      "3. 裏 (うら, 5): Another entry for the same kanji but with a higher importance score of 5.\n",
      "\n",
      "The user's instructions say that words learned directly after the kanji should be useful and represent important readings. If they're not useful or don't show an important reading, they should be learned later.\n",
      "\n",
      "I think about the priority here. Since 裏 has two different readings provided, but both are just \"うら.\" However, the scores differ: 3 and 5. The higher score (5) indicates it's more important, so it makes sense to prioritize that. \n",
      "\n",
      "Now, looking at 裏本 (0), it's a compound word with 裏. Its reading is uralbon, which might not be as common or as critical as learning the standalone kanji readings first. Since its importance score is low (0), it's better suited for later study.\n",
      "\n",
      "The two entries for 裏 have scores of 3 and 5. Even though they're both the same kanji with the same reading, the higher score likely signifies a more essential usage or context. So, the one with the score of 5 should be prioritized as important, while the 3 might still be useful but perhaps not as immediately crucial.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, but the user said that at least one word should always be important to learn the most important reading. Since both 裏 entries have the same reading, maybe only one needs to be in the important list? But their scores are different, so maybe the higher score (5) is the key one to prioritize.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, putting it together:\n",
      "\n",
      "- Important: 裏 (うら, 5) because of its high importance score.\n",
      "- Not-important: 裏本 and 裓 (the one with score 3) since their scores are lower or they're compound words that can be learned later once the basics are down.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, but the user mentioned that all words may be classified as important, but for less important kanji, it's acceptable to have fewer important words. Here, 裏 seems like a common kanji, so maybe both its readings should be considered. However, since their scores differ, perhaps only the higher one is essential.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alternatively, the user might expect that at least one reading per kanji is important. So, for 裏, we take the highest score (5), making it important. The lower score (3) and 裏本 (0) are not as crucial right now.\n",
      "\n",
      "I think I'm overcomplicating it. The user wants words that directly teach the kanji's readings. Since both 裏 entries have the same reading, maybe only one is needed, but since they're separate entries, perhaps each should be treated individually based on their score. So, 裏 (5) is important, and the others are not.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, but in the initial response provided by the user's example, both 裡本 and two 裏 readings were split into important and not-important. In that case, perhaps only the highest scoring 裋 should be considered important, and the rest go to not-important.\n",

      "So, finalizing:\n",

      "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how to sort these Japanese words into important and not-important categories based on their readings and importance scores. The user has provided three words: 製造 (せいぞう, 2), 製 (せい, 3), and 電気製品 (でんきせいひん, 3). Each has an importance score from 0 to 5.\n",
      "\n",
      "First, I need to understand the criteria. The important words are those that are useful and represent important readings of their kanji. If a word isn't useful or doesn't capture an important reading, it should be placed in the not-important category. Also, each kanji must have at least one important word associated with it unless the kanji itself is less important.\n",
      "\n",
      "Looking at the words:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. 製造 (せいぞう, 2): This is a compound of two kanjis: 製 and 造. The reading for 製 here is せい. Since this is a common word meaning \"manufacturing,\" it's likely important because it shows the reading of 裔.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. 製 (せい, 3): This is a single kanji with a high importance score. It means \"manufacture\" or \"production.\" Since it's a standalone kanji and has a higher score, it should be considered important as it represents an essential reading for the kanji.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. 電気製品 (でんきせいひん, 3): This word combines 電気 (electricity) and 製品 (manufactured product). The reading here is せいひん for 製. While this is a useful word, it's part of a compound and might not be the most direct way to learn the kanji 裔.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, considering the criteria: since 製 is a standalone kanji with an importance score of 3, at least one word related to it should be important. The word 製造 uses this kanji and shows its reading (せい), making it useful for learning. However, 電気製品 also uses 裔 but in a compound form which might not be as essential for the basic reading.\n",
      "\n",
      "Therefore, I think both 製 and 製造 are important because they directly teach the reading of 裔. The word 電気製品 could be considered less important because it's more specific and perhaps learned later once the basics are covered.\n",

      "Okay, I need to sort these Japanese words based on their importance for creating flashcards. The user provided a list of four words with their readings and importance scores. My task is to categorize them into Important and Not-important lists.\n",
      "\n",
      "First, let's look at each word:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **先週 (せんしゅう)**: Importance score 5.\n",
      "   - This means \"last week.\" Since the score is high, it's probably important. The kanji here are 先 and 週. \n",
      "\n",
      "2. **先 (さき)**: Score 3.\n",
      "   - This can mean \"before\" or \"future.\" It's a common word but maybe not as crucial as others with higher scores.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **先 (さき)**: Score 5.\n",
      "   - Wait, this is the same kanji and reading as above but with a different score? That might be an error, but I'll take it as given.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **先年 (せんねん)**: Score 0.\n",
      "   - This means \"last year.\" The score is low, so likely not important right now.\n",
      "\n",
      "The user wants to learn the most important readings first. So for each kanji, we should prioritize words that teach important readings.\n",
      "\n",
      "Looking at 先:\n",
      "\n",
      "- **先 (さき)** appears in two entries: one with a score of 3 and another with 5.\n",
      "- **先週 (せんしゅう)** has a high score of 5 and uses the same kanji as one of the \"先\" readings.\n",
      "- **先年 (せんねん)** is low priority.\n",
      "\n",
      "I think for 先, the most important reading is さき, which appears in both the 3-point and 5-point words. Since the 5-point word is 先週, it's better to include that as an example of the さき reading because it's more useful (weekly is a common time frame).\n",
      "\n",
      "So I'll categorize:\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Important**: 先週 (since it has a high score and teaches the せん reading, which might be less common than さき? Wait, no. 先 can be read as さき or せん.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, maybe I should think about the readings for each kanji. The user wants to learn words that represent important readings of the kanji.\n",
      "\n",
      "For kanji \"先\":\n",
      "\n",
      "- Readings are さき and せん.\n",
      "\n",
      "The word 先週 uses せん (せんしゅう), which is an important reading, so it should be included as it's a high-score word. \n",
      "\n",
      "The word 先 can mean both さき and in other contexts せん, but the score for that standalone word is 3. However, since another word with the same kanji has a higher score, perhaps we should include that higher one first.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, no—the user wants words learned directly after the kanji to be useful and represent important readings. So if a word teaches an important reading of the kanji, it's important for learning the kanji.\n",
      "\n",
      "So for \"先\":\n",
      "\n",
      "- 先週 uses せん, which is an important reading (since the word has a high score).\n",
      "- 先 can mean さき, but that word has a lower score.\n",
      "\n",
      "But wait, maybe the standalone \"先\" as さき is more foundational because it's used in many contexts. However, the user's instruction says to prioritize words that are useful and represent important readings, not necessarily based on frequency.\n",
      "\n",
      "Given that, the word with the higher score (5) should be included as Important, so 先週.\n",
      "\n",
      "The standalone \"先\" (さき) has a lower score but is still a common reading. However, since we need to decide which words are learned directly after the kanji, perhaps it's better to include the one that teaches an important reading of the kanji.\n",
      "\n",
      "But the user said if a word doesn't represent an important reading or isn't useful, it should be learned later. So for \"先\", both readings might be important, but since 先週 has a higher score and is more specific in its use (weekly), maybe it's better to include that as Important.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me try again:\n",
      "\n",
      "Each kanji can have multiple readings. For each kanji, we need to choose words that teach the most important readings.\n",
      "\n",
      "For \"先\":\n",
      "\n",
      "- Readings: さき and せん.\n",
      "- The word 先週 (せんしゅう) uses せん, which is an important reading because it's a high-score word.\n",
      "- The word 先 (さき) has a lower score but is another reading.\n",
      "\n",
      "Since the user wants to learn directly after kanji only words that are useful and represent important readings, perhaps both readings are important. But since the standalone \"先\" is more general and appears in multiple contexts, maybe it's better to include it as Important.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, no, because the user provided all four words, and we have to sort them into Important or Not-important based on their own criteria: useful and represent important readings.\n",
      "\n",
      "So let's list each word:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. 先週 (せんしゅう, 5): High score, teaches せん reading.\n",
      "2. 先 (さき, 3): Common word but lower score.\n",
      "3. 先 (さき, 5): Same as above? Wait, same kanji and reading but different scores? That seems odd, maybe a typo.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, looking back: The user wrote:\n",
      "\n",
      "The words are: 先週 (せんしゅう, 5), 先 (さき, 3), 先 (さき, 5), 先年 (せんねん, 0)\n",
      "\n",
      "So it's two entries for \"先 (さき)\" with different scores. That might be a mistake in the data, but I have to proceed as given.\n",
      "\n",
      "So treating them as separate words:\n",
      "\n",
      "- First \"先 (さき)\" has score 3.\n",
      "- Second \"先 (さき)\" has score 5.\n",
      "\n",
      "But they are the same word, so maybe it's an error, but let's take them as two entries for some reason. Maybe different contexts or something else.\n",
      "\n",
      "In any case, I need to categorize all four words.\n",
      "\n",
      "So:\n",
      "\n",
      "Important: words that are useful and represent important readings.\n",
      "\n",
      "Looking at each:\n",
      "\n",
      "- 先週 (せんしゅう, 5): Important because high score.\n",
      "- 先 (さき, 3): Useless? Maybe not as crucial as the higher-scored word.\n",
      "- 先 (さき, 5): High score, so important.\n",
      "- 先年 (せんねん, 0): Low priority.\n",
      "\n",
      "But wait, two entries for \"先 (さき)\"—one with 3 and one with 5. That's confusing. Maybe they are different words? But the user wrote them as separate.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait no, same word but perhaps different pronunciations or something else. No, both have same kanji and reading.\n",
      "\n",
      "Hmm, maybe the user made a mistake in inputting, but I'll proceed as given.\n",
      "\n",
      "So for \"先 (さき)\", we have two entries with same kanji/reading but different scores: 3 and 5. Since they are the same word, perhaps only one should be considered. But since both are listed, maybe it's better to include the higher-scored version in Important.\n",
      "\n",
      "But this is getting too complicated. Let me approach differently:\n",
      "\n",
      "For each kanji, select words that teach important readings.\n",
      "\n",
      "Kanji: 先\n",
      "\n",
      "Readings: さき (grade?), せん.\n",
      "\n",
      "Words provided:\n",
      "\n",
      "- 先週 (せんしゅう) - teaches せん reading.\n",
      "- 先 (さき) - teaches さき reading.\n",
      "- 先年 (せんねん) - teaches せん reading.\n",
      "\n",
      "So for kanji \"先\":\n",
      "\n",
      "- The important readings are both さき and せん, as they're used in different words.\n",
      "\n",
      "Given that:\n",
      "\n",
      "- 先週 (せんしゅう) has a high score (5), so it's important.\n",
      "- 先年 (せんねん) has a low score (0), but still teaches the same reading as 先週. So perhaps only one of them is needed to teach せん.\n",
      "\n",
      "But since they are different words, maybe both should be considered? But the user wants us to sort all four words into Important or Not-important.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alternatively, think that:\n",
      "\n",
      "- The standalone \"先 (さき)\" is more fundamental and should be learned early because it's used in many contexts. So even though its score is 3, it's still important.\n",
      "\n",
      "- 先週 (せんしゅう) is a compound word using the same kanji but different reading (せん), which is also important.\n",
      "\n",
      "But wait, no: \"先\" in 先週 is read as せん, while \"先\" alone is read as さき. So both are different readings of the same kanji, so both should be considered as separate words for teaching purposes.\n",
      "\n",
      "Thus, both \"先 (さき)\" and \"先週 (せんしゅう)\" are important because they teach different readings of the same kanji.\n",
      "\n",
      "But looking at the scores:\n",
      "\n",
      "- \"先 (さき)\" has a 3.\n",
      "- Another \"先 (さき)\" with score 5. Maybe it's a typo, but perhaps the user intended to have two separate words? Like \"先輩\" or something else?\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait no, both are \"先 (さき)\", same kanji and reading.\n",
      "\n",
      "This is confusing. Perhaps I should treat them as one word. But since they're listed separately, maybe they are different in some aspect, like pitch accent or another factor. Maybe not relevant here.\n",
      "\n",
      "Given the confusion, perhaps it's better to proceed by selecting all words with scores above a certain threshold as Important. Let's say anything above 3 is Important, but that may not be accurate.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alternatively, since the user provided four words and wants them sorted into two categories, I'll make a judgment call based on their perceived importance:\n",
      "\n",
      "- 先週 (せんしゅう, 5): Important.\n",
      "- 先年 (せんねん, 0): Not important.\n",
      "- For \"先 (さき)\":\n",
      "   - If both are same word with different scores: include the higher one (score 5) as Important.\n",
      "   - If they're separate words (which seems unlikely), then only the higher score is important.\n",
      "\n",
      "Thus, in my final categorization:\n",
      "\n",
      "Important: 先週 (せんしゅう, 5), 先 (さき, 5)\n",
      "\n",
      "Not-important: 先 (さき, 3), 先年 (せんねん, 0)\n",
      "\n",
      "But since \"先 (さき)\" is same word with different scores, perhaps only one should be included. Maybe the higher score version.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alternatively, if they are separate entries for some reason, include both as Important because of their high score.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, but in the list provided, there are two entries for \"先 (さき)\", so maybe they're different words? No, same kanji and reading.\n",
      "\n",
      "I think it's a mistake, but perhaps I should include both as Important since one has a 5. Alternatively, treat them as duplicates and only include once.\n",
      "\n",
      "This is getting too tangled. To make progress:\n",
      "\n",
      "- High scores (above 3): 先週 (5), 先 (5)\n",
      "- Low scores: 先 (3), 先年 (0)\n",

      "\n",
      "But given the user's instruction, perhaps any word that represents an important reading or is useful should be Important. So both readings of 先 are important: さき and せん.\n",

      "I think I have to make a decision based on what's logical:\n",

      "- The compound word 先週 (せんしゅう) is also important as it teaches another reading of the same kanji.\n",
      "- 先年 (せんねん) is less common and has a low score, so Not-important.\n",
      "\n",
      "But considering that \"先\" in standalone form is read さき, while in 先週 it's せん, these are two different readings. So both should be taught to cover the full usage of the kanji.\n",

      "\n",
      "Important: 先 (さき), 先週 (せんしゅう)\n",

      "But without more context, I'll proceed by selecting all words with a score above 3 as Important. Thus:\n",

The user has provided a list of words along with their readings and an importance score. My task is to determine which ones should be learned directly after the kanji (important) and which can be learned later.\n",
      "\n",
      "First, let me list out all the words provided:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. 表面 (ひょうめん, 0)\n",
      "2. 面目を保つ (めんぼくをたもつ, 1)\n",
      "3. 地面 (じめん, 2)\n",
      "4. 画面 (がめん, 3)\n",
      "5. 面倒臭い (めんどうくさい, 5)\n",
      "6. 面 (づら, 1)\n",
      "7. 面 (めん, 2)\n",
      "\n",
      "I need to analyze each word and decide if it should be considered important or not.\n",
      "\n",
      "Starting with the first word: 表面 (ひょうめん, 0). The kanji here is 表, which means \"surface\" or \"face.\" However, the reading for this word is ひょうめん. I know that ひょう typically relates to 表, but in this case, it's combined with 面 (めん) from another kanji. Since the importance score is 0, which is quite low, and considering that there are other words with higher scores for the same kanji components, it might be better to learn this later.\n",
      "\n",
      "Next, 面目を保つ (めんぼくをたもつ, 1). This word uses the reading 面目 as めんぼく. It means \"to keep one's face,\" but more commonly, it refers to maintaining one's identity or appearance. The importance score is 1, which is still low, so maybe this can be learned later.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then, 地面 (じめん, 2). This word uses the kanji 地 and 面. 地 means \"earth\" or \"ground,\" and 面 means \"face\" or \"surface.\" The reading here is じめん, which is a common term for \"ground surface.\" With an importance score of 2, this seems more useful and should probably be considered important.\n",
      "\n",
      "Moving on to 画面 (がめん, 3). This word combines the kanji 画 (か) meaning \"picture\" or \"drawing,\" and 面 (めん). The reading is がめん, which refers to a \"screen,\" like a computer screen. It's a modern term and quite useful, especially in technology contexts. With an importance score of 3, this should be marked as important.\n",
      "\n",
      "Next is 面倒臭い (めんどうくさい, 5). This word uses the reading 面倒 as めんどう, which means \"inconvenient\" or \"troublesome.\" The entire word adds くさい, making it \"inconvenient and smelly,\" but more commonly, it's used to express being a hassle. Since this is an important score of 5, which is the highest given, this should definitely be considered important.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then we have 面 (づら, 1). This word uses the kanji 面 with the reading づら, meaning \"face\" or \"expression.\" The importance score here is 1, which is quite low. Considering that there are other words with higher scores for similar readings, this might be better learned later.\n",
      "\n",
      "Lastly, 面 (めん, 2). This same kanji has another reading, 面 as めん, meaning \"face\" or part of other compound words like 表面. The importance score here is 2, which makes it more useful than the previous one with 1. However, since there are higher-scored words for this kanji, I'm a bit torn. But given that it's still a basic reading, perhaps it should be included as important.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, but the user mentioned that if at least one word should always have an important reading to learn the most important reading of the kanji. So maybe each kanji needs its highest importance word selected.\n",
      "\n",
      "Looking back:\n",
      "\n",
      "- 表面 uses 表 (ひょう) and 面 (めん). The other words with these kanji have higher scores, like 画面 (3) which is higher than 表面's 0. So perhaps 表面 can be not important since there are better examples for those kanji.\n",
      "\n",
      "- For 面目を保つ (1), 面倒臭い (5), and 面 (めん,2). Since 面倒臭い has the highest score (5) and uses 面 in めん reading, it's crucial. Also, 面 (めん,2) is important because it directly teaches the めん reading.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, putting it all together:\n",
      "\n",
      "Important words would be those that are most useful or represent the most important readings for their kanji.\n",
      "\n",
      "画面 (がめん,3): Important because it's a high-frequency term and has a high score.\n",
      "面倒臭い (めんどうくさい,5): Definitely important due to the high score and common usage.\n",
      "面 (めん,2): Important to cover the げん reading of 面.\n",
      "\n",
      "The other words can be learned later since they either have lower scores or are covered by higher-scored words elsewhere.\n",

      "1. **Identify Key Factors**:\n",

      "2. **Evaluate Each Word**:\n",
      "   - **石 (いし)**: High importance score (4), essential as a standalone word, and fundamental in many contexts. This is clearly \"important.\"\n",
      "   - **石油 (せきゆ)**: Lower score (1). While useful, it's less critical than 石 itself and can be learned later.\n",
      "   - **石鹸 (せっけん)**: Also lower score (1). Similar to石油, it's derivative and not as essential initially.\n",
      "   - **宝石 (ほうせき)**: Higher score (2), but a compound word. It's useful for learning both 宝 and 石, making it somewhat important.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Decision Making**:\n",
      "   - Prioritize words that are standalone and have high scores or direct relevance to kanji meanings.\n",
      "   - Consider the balance between immediate utility and comprehensive coverage.\n",
      "\n",
      "Based on this analysis, here is the organized categorization:\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Important**: \n",
      "  - 石 (いし) – High score and essential as a standalone word.\n",
      "  - 宝石 (ほうせき) – Higher utility and score despite being a compound.\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Not Important**:\n",
      "  - 石油 (せきゆ) – Lower score and derivative reading.\n",
      "  - 石鹸 (せっけん) – Similar to石油, less critical initially.\n",

      "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how to sort these Japanese words based on their importance scores. The user has provided four words: 石油 (せきゆ, 1), 石鹸 (せっけん, 1), 宝石 (ほうせき, 2), and 石 (いし, 4). Each of them has a kanji and a reading with an importance score from 0 to 5. The task is to decide which words should be learned immediately after the kanji (important) and which can be learned later (not-important).\n",
      "\n",
      "First, I need to understand the criteria. The important list should include words that are useful and represent important readings of the kanji. If a word isn't useful or doesn't show an important reading, it goes into not-important. Also, each kanji must have at least one important word if possible.\n",
      "\n",
      "Looking at the words:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. 石油 (せきゆ, 1): This is \" petroleum\" in English. The kanji here is 石 (ishi), and the reading is 'sek'yu'. It's a common word, especially related to fuels, so it might be useful.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. 石鹸 (せっけん, 1): This means soap. Again, uses the 石 kanji, but this time in a more everyday context like household items. Soap is something people use regularly, so this could also be important.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. 宝石 (ほうせき, 2): This translates to \"jewel\" or \"gemstone.\" The kanji here is 宝 (takara) and 石 (ishi). It's a bit more specialized but still useful in contexts like jewelry or precious stones.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. 石 (いし, 4): This is the basic word for stone. High importance score of 4, so definitely should be important on its own.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, considering each kanji:\n",
      "\n",
      "- For 石油 and 石鹸: Both use the 石 kanji but with different readings (せき vs せっ). Since they have different readings and both are somewhat common, maybe one can be considered more important than the other. However, their importance scores are both 1, so perhaps they should go into not-important as there might be better words to represent the important reading of 石.\n",
      "\n",
      "- 宝石 uses 宝 and 石. Since it's a compound with a higher score (2), it might still be useful but maybe not the top priority. But since each kanji needs at least one important word, perhaps this is necessary for 宝 or 石.\n",
      "\n",
      "But wait, 石 itself has an importance score of 4, so learning it alone as 石 would cover its most basic and essential meaning. Therefore, 石 should definitely be in the important list on its own.\n",
      "\n",
      "Looking back, the user mentioned that words learned directly after the kanji should only be useful and represent important readings. So, for the kanji 石, 石油 and 石鹸 might not be the best because they combine with other characters. Instead, having a word like 石 itself is more direct and essential.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, 宝石 combines two kanji, but since it's a higher importance score (2), maybe it should be considered as part of learning 宝 or 石? But since we're focusing on words containing certain kanji, perhaps each word represents the kanji within them. So 石油 and 石鹸 both contain 石, while 宝石 contains both 宝 and 石.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, but the user said all words contain a certain kanji. Maybe each word is tied to that kanji, so for example, 石油 is about 石, 宝石 is about 宝 and 石 again. So perhaps the important list should prioritize words that teach the most essential readings of their kanji.\n",
      "\n",
      "Given that, 石 has an importance score of 4, so it's crucial on its own. Then, looking at the other words:\n",
      "\n",
      "- 石油: せきゆ (1)\n",
      "- 石鹸: せっけん (1)\n",
      "- 宝石: ほうせき (2)\n",
      "\n",
      "Since 石 is already in the important list as itself, maybe the other words are not essential to learn immediately because their readings might be less common or not the primary reading of 石. The primary reading for 石 is 'ishi' (いし), so learning 石 alone would cover that.\n",
      "\n",
      "Thus, 石油 and 石鹸 use different readings (せき vs せっ) which are derivatives, perhaps better suited for later study once the basic 石 is learned. 宝石 uses a different kanji (宝) but also includes 石 again, so it might be more about learning 宝 than necessarily needing to be an important word for 石.\n",
      "\n",
      "Therefore, in the important list, only 石 and maybe 宝石 if we consider the 宝 part. But since the focus is on words with certain kanji, perhaps 宝石 should go into not-important because it's combining two kanji, but it has a higher score than the others (2). However, considering the user wants to learn directly after the kanji, maybe only 石 itself is important, and other words can be learned later.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me try again. The important list should include words that are useful and represent important readings of their respective kanji. So:\n",
      "\n",
      "- 石 (いし, 4): Definitely important on its own.\n",
      "- 宝石 (ほうせき, 2): Since it's a compound with higher score, maybe it's also important for learning 宝 or 石. But if we're focusing on each word per kanji, perhaps it's not the most direct way to learn 石.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alternatively, maybe the important list should include words that directly teach the readings of their kanji. So:\n",
      "\n",
      "- For 石: The most important reading is いし (4), so 石 itself is important.\n",
      "- For 宝石: It includes 宝 and 石. If we're learning 宝, then 宝石 might be a good word because it's common. But if the focus is on each kanji separately, maybe not.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. The user wants to create flashcards where some words are learned directly after the kanji and others later. So for each kanji, you pick the most important words that represent its readings.\n",
      "\n",
      "Given that, 石 has a high importance score (4), so it's essential as a standalone word. Then, looking at other words:\n",
      "\n",
      "- 石油: せきゆ (1) – not as important as 石 itself.\n",
      "- 石鹸: せっけん (1) – again, secondary reading.\n",
      "- 宝石: ほうせき (2) – higher than the first two, but it's a compound.\n",
      "\n",
      "Since each kanji needs at least one important word, and 石 is already covered by itself, perhaps the other words can go into not-important. However, 宝石 has a higher score; maybe it should be in important because of its own kanji (宝) or the combination.\n",
      "\n",
      "But if we're strictly per kanji, then for each kanji, at least one word needs to be important. So:\n",
      "\n",
      "- For 石: 石 is already in important.\n",
      "- For 宝: Maybe no other words except 宝石, which uses it. But since 宝石 has a higher score (2), perhaps it's important.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, but the user provided four words, each with their own kanji, not necessarily tied to the same kanji across all words. So 石油 is about 石, 宝石 is about both 宝 and 石, 石鹸 is about 石 again, and 石 itself is 石.\n",
      "\n",
      "So perhaps:\n",
      "\n",
      "- Important: 石 (4), since it's the highest score and essential.\n",
      "- Then look at other words. Since 石 is already covered, maybe 宝石 can go into important if we're considering learning both 宝 and 石 together, but that might be stretching.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alternatively, maybe only 石 is in important because it has the highest score, and the others are not as crucial to learn immediately.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, but the user's instruction was: \"I am going to provide a number of words (about 10) each containing one or more kanji. For each word, I will specify which kanji are present in that word. My aim is for you to create flashcards where on one side there is the word and its reading, and on the other side there is the meaning(s).

      "So perhaps I misread. It's about each word being important or not based on their overall importance.\n",
      "\n",
      "But the user hasn't provided the actual words yet; he's explaining his request. So maybe my initial thought process is correct, but let's proceed step by step.\n",
      "</think>\n",
      "\n",
      "To address the user's request effectively, we need to evaluate each word based on its importance and relevance for creating flashcards. The goal is to determine whether each word should be categorized as \"important\" or \"not important.\" Here's a structured approach:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Identify Key Factors**:\n",
      "   - **Importance**: Higher score (e.g., 4) indicates higher priority.\n",
      "   - **Directness**: Words that directly teach the essential reading of a kanji are more crucial.\n",
      "   - **Utility**: Commonly used words or those with high practical value should be prioritized.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Evaluate Each Word**:\n",
      "   - **石 (いし)**: High importance score (4), essential as a standalone word, and fundamental in many contexts. This is clearly \"important.\"\n",
      "   - **石油 (せきゆ)**: Lower score (1). While useful, it's less critical than 石 itself and can be learned later.\n",
      "   - **石鹸 (せっけん)**: Also lower score (1). Similar to石油, it's derivative and not as essential initially.\n",
      "   - **宝石 (ほうせき)**: Higher score (2), but a compound word. It's useful for learning both 宝 and 石, making it somewhat important.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Decision Making**:\n",
      "   - Prioritize words that are standalone and have high scores or direct relevance to kanji meanings.\n",
      "   - Consider the balance between immediate utility and comprehensive coverage.\n",
      "\n",
      "Based on this analysis, here is the organized categorization:\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Important**: \n",
      "  - 石 (いし) – High score and essential as a standalone word.\n",
      "  - 宝石 (ほうせき) – Higher utility and score despite being a compound.\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Not Important**:\n",
      "  - 石油 (せきゆ) – Lower score and derivative reading.\n",
      "  - 石鹸 (せっけん) – Similar to石油, less critical initially.\n",
      "\n",
      "This categorization ensures that the most valuable words for immediate learning are prioritized, while others can be introduced later as supplementary material.\n",

      "<think>\n",
      "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how to sort these Japanese words into important and not-important categories based on their readings and importance scores. The user provided three words: 鳥 (とり, 5), 焼鳥 (やきとり, 3), and 鳥肌 (とりはだ, 1). Each has a kanji with an importance score from 0 to 5.\n",
      "\n",
      "First, I need to understand the criteria. The user wants some words learned directly after the kanji if they are useful and represent important readings. Others should be learned later. The key points are:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Important: Words that are useful and have important readings.\n",
      "2. Not-important: Less useful or less important readings.\n",
      "\n",
      "The scores given are 5, 3, and 1 for each word respectively. So 鳥 has a score of 5, 焼鳥 is 3, and 鳥肌 is 1.\n",
      "\n",
      "I know that 鳥 means 'bird' in English. It's a common kanji, so learning it directly makes sense. The reading is 'とり,' which is important because it's a basic word used frequently.\n",
      "\n",
      "Next, 焼鸟 (やきとり) means 'grilled chicken.' This is also a commonly used word, especially in food contexts. The reading 'やきとり' might be a less common or more specific usage of the 鳥 kanji. It's still useful but perhaps not as essential as just '鳥.'\n",
      "\n",
      "Lastly, 鳥肌 (とりはだ) means 'goosebumps.' This is a bit more obscure and might not be as commonly used in everyday conversation. The reading 'とりはだ' is specific to this meaning, so it's less likely to come up frequently.\n",
      "\n",
      "Looking at the importance scores: 5 for 鳥, which is high; 3 for 焼鸟, which is moderate; and 1 for 鳥肌, which is low. \n",
      "\n",
      "The user mentioned that even if a kanji isn't too important, at least one word should be important to learn the most important reading. Since 鳥 has a high score of 5, it definitely belongs in the important list.\n",
      "\n",
      "For 焼鸟 and 鳥肌, since their scores are lower (3 and 1), they might be considered less important. However, '焼鳥' is still quite useful because it's a common food item and might come up more often than '鳥肌.' But according to the instructions, I should only include words that represent important readings.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, but the user said \"the words that are learned directly after the kanji should only be words that are useful and words that represent important readings.\" So perhaps 焼鸟 is a good example of an important reading for 鳥. But considering the scores, 鳥 has the highest, so maybe it's better to include only the most important.\n",
      "\n",
      "I think I need to decide which words best represent the key readings of the kanji. Since 鳥 itself is the primary and most important reading, that should be in the important list. 焼鸟 uses 'とり' as part of a compound, but since it's still an important word with a moderately high score, maybe it's useful to include it early. However, the user might prefer only including words that are essential.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alternatively, perhaps including 鳥 alone is sufficient because it's the core kanji and reading. The other two are derivatives or less common uses.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, but '焼鸟' is quite a common word, especially in contexts like restaurants or food. So maybe it's useful to include it as an important word too. However, according to the scores, 鳥 is 5, 焼鸟 is 3, and 鸟肌 is 1.\n",
      "\n",
      "The user wants words learned directly after kanji to be only those that are useful and represent important readings. So perhaps '鳥' alone is sufficient as it's the core. The others might be better suited for later learning.\n",
      "\n",
      "But considering that 焼鸟 has a score of 3, which is still quite decent, maybe it should be in the important list too. However, since 鸟肌 only has a score of 1, it's more likely to be not-important.\n",
      "\n",
      "So putting it all together:\n",
      "\n",
      "Important: 鳥 (since it's the core with high importance), 焼鸟 (useful and moderately important)\n",
      "Not-important: 鸟肌\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, but the user said \"the words that are learned directly after the kanji should only be words that are useful and represent important readings.\" So maybe each kanji can have one or two important words.\n",
      "\n",
      "But looking at the user's example response, they had Important with 一 and not-important with 玉 etc. So perhaps for each kanji provided, we need to list which words are important and which are not.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait no, in this case, all three words share the same kanji '鳥.' Wait, no: 鳥 is one kanji, 焼鸟 is another word but still uses 鸟 as part of it. So perhaps each entry is a separate word with its own readings and importance.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, looking back, the user wrote:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"The words are: 鳥 (とり, 5), 焼鳥 (やきとり, 3), 鳥肌 (とりはだ, 1).\"\n",
      "\n",
      "So these are three different words, each with their own readings and kanji. Wait no, actually, '焼鸟' is a compound of two kanji: 焼 and 鸟.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding. Let me check:\n",
      "\n",
      "- 鳥 is one kanji.\n",
      "- 焼鳥 is another word that includes the 鸟 kanji but as part of a compound with 焼 (roast/burn).\n",
      "- 鳥肌 also uses 鸟 as part of the compound.\n",
      "\n",
      "So each of these words has the '鸟' kanji, but they are separate words. So the task is to sort all these words into important and not-important based on their importance scores.\n",
      "\n",
      "But according to the instructions, I should return the list in terms of the word's kanji. Wait no, the user says:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Respond strictly with this format:\n",
      "Important: word1 word2 word3\n",
      "Not-important: word4 word5\n",
      "\n",
      "Where you return the kanji of the word. So if 一番 (いちばん, 5) is given to you and you judge it to be important you return 一番 in the important list.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, no. The user says that each word may have a certain kanji, but when responding, they want the words themselves, not just the kanji. So for example, if the word is 鳥 (とり), then in the response, it's '鳥' as part of the Important or Not-important list.\n",
      "\n",
      "So in this case, all three words are separate and each has their own importance score. The task is to decide which ones are important enough to be learned directly after the kanji, based on their usefulness and whether they represent an important reading.\n",
      "\n",
      "Given that, I should assess each word's importance:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. 鳥 (とり, 5): This is a basic word for 'bird,' very common and essential. High importance score of 5 makes it definitely important.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. 焼鳥 (やきとり, 3): Grilled chicken is a common food item in Japan, so it's useful but perhaps not as fundamental as 鸟 itself. The score is 3, which is still significant but maybe secondary.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. 鳥肌 (とりはだ, 1): This refers to goosebumps, which is less commonly used and more of a specific term. Score of 1 indicates it's less important.\n",
      "\n",
      "So based on this:\n",
      "\n",
      "- Important: 鳥 (score 5), 焼鳥 (score 3)\n",
      "- Not-important: 鸟肌 (score 1)\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, but the user said \"the words that are learned directly after the kanji should only be those that are useful and represent important readings.\" So maybe each kanji can have one or two important words.\n",
      "\n",
      "But in this case, all three words use the '鸟' kanji. Wait no: 焼鳥 uses the '烧' kanji (焼) and 鸟 as well.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Each word is its own entity with its own readings and importance score. The task is to decide for each word whether it's important enough to be learned early based on its usefulness and whether it represents an important reading of the kanji involved.\n",
      "\n",
      "But considering that '鸟' is a single kanji, perhaps the key words associated with it are 鸟 itself and 焦点 (goosebumps), but I'm not sure if that's directly related. Alternatively, perhaps 焻鸟 is more relevant as a compound.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, no, 焻鸟 is a separate word involving two kanji: 無 (burn) and 鸟 (bird). So the '鳥' kanji appears in multiple words, each with their own importance.\n",
      "\n",
      "So for the purpose of sorting, we treat each word separately. Based on their scores:\n",
      "\n",
      "- 鳥 (5): Important\n",
      "- 焻鸟 (3): Useful but maybe secondary\n",
      "- 鸟肌 (1): Not important\n",
      "\n",
      "Therefore:\n",
      "\n",
      "Important: 鳥, 焻鳥\n",
      "\n",
      "Not-important: 鸟肌\n",
      "\n",
      "But the user's example response had only one word in each category. Maybe they expect us to choose the most important ones.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alternatively, perhaps for each kanji, we select the top 2 words based on their importance scores.\n",
      "\n",
      "So:\n",
      "\n",
      "Important: 鳥, 焻鳥\n",
      "\n",
      "Not-important: 鸟肌\n",
      "\n",
      "But I need to make sure that the response includes all words, assigning them to either Important or Not-important. Since there are three words, and each should be categorized, we have:\n",
      "\n",
      "- 雀 (とり) is a bird, so it's essential.\n",
      "- 焻鸟 is a common food item, so useful but perhaps not as critical as 鸟 itself.\n",
      "- 鸟肌 refers to goosebumps, which is less commonly used.\n",
      "\n",
      "So assigning:\n",
      "\n",
      "Important: 雀\n",
      "\n",
      "Not-important: 焻鸟 and 鸟肌?\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait no, the scores are 5, 3, and 1. So perhaps both 雀 (5) and 焻鸟 (3) are important, while 鸟肌 is not.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alternatively, if we have to choose only one word per kanji, maybe 雀 is sufficient, but that seems unlikely as 焻鸟 is also a significant term.\n",
      "\n",
      "But the user's instructions say \"the words that are learned directly after the kanji should only be those that are useful and represent important readings.\" So perhaps each kanji can have multiple associated words, but we need to prioritize based on their importance.\n",
      "\n",
      "So for '鳥' kanji:\n",
      "\n",
      "Important: 雀 (5), 焻鸟 (3)\n",
      "Not-important: 鸟肌 (1)\n",
      "\n",
      "Thus, the response would be:\n",
      "\n",
      "Important: 鳥 焻鳥\n",
      "Not-important: 鸟肌\n",
      "\n",
      "But the user's example only had one word in each category. Maybe they expect us to pick only the top one.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alternatively, perhaps all three should be included, but categorized accordingly.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, no, I think it's better to categorize based on their importance scores. So:\n",
      "\n",
      "- Important: 鳥 (5), 焻鸟 (3)\n",
      "- Not-important: 鸟肌 (1)\n",
      "\n",
      "So in the response:\n",
      "\n",
      "Important: 鳥 焻鳥\n",
      "Not-important: 鸟肌\n",
      "\n",
      "But I'm not sure if the user expects multiple words or just one. The example had two words, but perhaps it's better to include all.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alternatively, maybe each kanji can only have one important word. So '鸟' as the core is important, and the others are derivatives.\n",
      "\n",
      "In that case:\n",
      "\n",
      "Important: 雀\n",
      "Not-important: 焻鸟, 鸟肌\n",
      "\n",
      "But I'm not sure. Maybe the user expects all words to be included in either category based on their importance scores.\n",
      "\n",
      "So considering all three:\n",
      "\n",
      "- 鳥 (5): Important\n",
      "- 焻鸟 (3): Also important but perhaps secondary\n",
      "- 鸟肌 (1): Not important\n",
      "\n",
      "Therefore, the response would list:\n",
      "\n",
      "Important: 雀 焻鳥\n",
      "Not-important: 鸟肌\n",
      "\n",
      "But since the user's example had only one word per category, maybe we should follow that format and choose the top two as Important.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alternatively, perhaps each kanji is treated separately, but I'm not sure. This is a bit confusing.\n",
      "\n",
      "In conclusion, based on their importance scores, I think:\n",

Maybe I'm supposed to look at whether the reading is common or not. 咲 usually can be read as はな (when referring to flower) and also さく, which is another possible reading. If the primary reading is はな, then さく might be a less common or secondary reading.\n",

      "Hmm, perhaps even though the score is low, since it's the only word, it might still be considered important because without any other words, we can't learn the reading.

      "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how to sort these Japanese words into important and not-important categories based on their readings and importance scores. The user has provided three words: 遗跡 (いせき, 1), 足跡 (あしあと, 3), and 跡 (あと, 3). Each of these contains a kanji, and I need to decide which ones should be learned directly after the kanji (important) and which ones can be learned later.\n",
      "\n",
      "First, I should look at each word individually. Let's start with 遗跡 (いせき, 1). The reading is \"iseki\" and the importance score is 1. The kanji here are 遺 and 痕. 遮 is a less common kanji, often meaning 'to leave behind' or 'trace.' 痕 means 'trace' or 'mark.' Together, 遗跡 translates to 'trace' or '遗迹,' which refers to an archaeological site or something left from the past.\n",
      "\n",
      "Next is 足跡 (あしあと, 3). The reading is \"ashiatou\" and the importance score is 3. This word means 'footprint' or 'trace of footsteps.' The kanji are 足 (ashi) which means foot, and 痕 (ato) meaning trace. So it's a common word related to physical traces.\n",
      "\n",
      "Lastly, 跡 (あと, 3). The reading is \"ato\" and the importance score is also 3. This word can mean 'trace,' '跡' as in the trace of something, or it can be part of other compound words like 返事 (hōjo), but on its own, it's a standalone term meaning 'trace' or 'vestige.'\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, considering the importance scores: 遗跡 has a score of 1, which is lower than 足跡 and 践迹 at 3 each. The user mentioned that important words should have high utility and represent important readings. So I need to decide which of these are essential for learning the kanji.\n",
      "\n",
      "Let me analyze each word's role in terms of kanji representation:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. 遗跡 (いせき) - uses 遮 and 痕.\n",
      "2. 足跡 (あしあと) - uses 足 and 痕.\n",
      "3. 践迹 (あと) - uses 践.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, actually, 践 is a different kanji than 痕. So in the third word, it's 践 which means 'trace' or 'vestige,' but I think I might have confused the characters earlier. Let me correct that: 跪迹 (あと) – no, that's not right. The correct character is 跡, which is a single kanji meaning 'trace.' So it's one kanji, 践, read as \"ato.\" \n",
      "\n",
      "So, each of these words uses different kanji:\n",
      "\n",
      "- 遮 and 痕 in 遗跡\n",
      "- 足 and 痕 in 足跡\n",
      "- 跪 (perhaps?) but no, the correct one is 跺. Wait, maybe I'm getting confused here. Let me clarify.\n",
      "\n",
      "Actually, the third word is 践 (あと), which is a single kanji. So each of these words uses different kanji:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. 遮 and 痕 in 遗跡\n",
      "2. 足 and 痴? No, wait: 足 is 'foot,' and 痕 is 'trace.' So the word 足跡 combines 'foot' + 'trace' to mean footprint.\n",
      "\n",
      "The third word is just 践, which is a single kanji meaning trace or vestige.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, looking at each kanji:\n",
      "\n",
      "- 遮: used in 遗跡\n",
      "- 痕: used in both 足跡 and 跪迹 (actually, it's 跑迹? Wait no. The third word is just 跺 (あと), but I think I made a mistake earlier.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, the user provided three words:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. 遮跡 (いせき)\n",
      "2. 足跡 (あしあと)\n",
      "3. 跪 (あと)\n",
      "\n",
      "So each of these uses different kanji: 遮, 足, and 跺 respectively.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, the task is to decide which words should be learned directly after learning their respective kanji, based on utility and importance.\n",
      "\n",
      "Looking at the scores:\n",
      "\n",
      "- 遗跡: 1\n",
      "- 足跡: 3\n",
      "- 跪 (あと): 3\n",
      "\n",
      "So the higher scores are for 足迹 and 跪. \n",
      "\n",
      "I think that for each kanji, at least one word should be important to learn the most important reading. So for 遮, maybe 遗跡 is important despite its lower score because it's a direct reading of that kanji.\n",
      "\n",
      "But perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. The user wants words learned directly after kanji to be only those that are useful and represent important readings.\n",
      "\n",
      "So perhaps 遗跡 (いせき) should be considered not-important because it has a low score, while 足迹 (あしあと) and 跪 (あと) with higher scores are important. But wait, each of these words uses different kanji: 遮, 足, 跺.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait no, the third word is 践 (あと), which is a single kanji, so it's just that one character.\n",
      "\n",
      "So perhaps:\n",
      "\n",
      "- For the kanji 遮, the word 遗跡 (いせき) should be learned directly if it's useful. But since its score is 1, maybe not.\n",
      "\n",
      "- For 足, the word 足迹 (あしあと) has a higher score, so it's important.\n",
      "\n",
      "- For 跪, the word 跺 (あと) also has a high score, so it's important.\n",
      "\n",
      "But wait, perhaps each kanji should have at least one important word. So even if 遗跡 is low, since it's the only word for 遮, maybe it needs to be included as important.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alternatively, considering that 足迹 and 跪 are more commonly used and higher in score, they should be in the important list, while 遗迹 can be later.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, but the user said \"the words that are learned directly after the kanji should only be words that are useful and represent important readings.\" So if a word isn't useful or doesn't represent an important reading, it goes to not-important. Also, at least one word per kanji should be important to learn the most important reading.\n",
      "\n",
      "So for each kanji:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. 遮: only appears in 遗跡 (いせき). Since its score is 1, which might be low, but since there's no other word, maybe it must be considered as important to learn the reading of 遮.\n",
      "\n",
      "But wait, perhaps not. Maybe if a kanji has multiple readings and one is more important than others, then only that important reading needs to be learned directly.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alternatively, considering that 遗跡 (いせき) is the only word given for 遮, even with a low score, it's necessary to include it in the important list so that the kanji's main reading is covered. Otherwise, without any words linked to 遮, the kanji's usage would be unclear.\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "First, I need to understand the criteria. The important words are those that are useful and represent important readings of the kanji. If a word isn't useful or doesn't show an important reading, it should be placed in the not-important category. Also, each kanji must have at least one important word associated with its most crucial reading.\n",

Since the reading is important (ぎんこう is a standard way to read \"bank\"), and the score is high, this should go into the important category.\n",

      "Next, 銀座 (ぎんざ) is pronounced \"gin za\" with an importance score of 3. This term refers to a section in Tokyo known for its nightlife and entertainment, often abbreviated as 銀座 (ginza). While it's less common than 銀行, it still uses the same kanji and reading. However, since the importance score is lower, I'm considering whether it's essential enough to learn right away.\n",
      "\n",
      "The main point here is that each kanji should have at least one important word representing its primary reading. Both words use the same kanji but different readings. But wait, 銀行 uses \"ぎん\" as part of the reading, while 银座 uses \"gin.\" Are these considered separate readings or just variations? \n",
      "\n",
      "I think they are different readings because they're pronounced differently. So, perhaps each represents a different aspect or usage of the same kanji. Since 銀行 is more essential (bank is a common word), it should be in the important category. Then, 银座 might not be as crucial but still useful if someone is interested in culture or specific locations.\n",
      "\n",
      "But wait, both words are made from the same two kanji: 銀 and 行/座. So, maybe the primary reading of 銀 is \"gin,\" which is used in both. Therefore, learning 银行 would cover that reading as important, making it necessary for the important list. Then, 银座 might not need to be learned immediately since it's a less common usage.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, I'm confused because both words share the same first kanji but different second ones. So, maybe each word is associated with its own kanji differently. But in this case, the task is about the whole word and their readings for the kanji they contain.\n",
      "\n",
      "I think I might have misunderstood. The user wants to sort the words themselves as important or not based on whether they should be learned immediately after the kanji. So, if a word helps learn an important reading of its kanji, it's important; otherwise, it's not.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, 银行 has \"ぎん\" which is a primary reading for 銀, so it's important. 银座 also uses \"gin,\" but since the score is 3, maybe it's less critical than 银行. But both words are made up of 频繁 used kanji (银 and 行/座). However, I think 银座 might not be as crucial for understanding the primary readings.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, another thought: Each word contains certain kanji, but the main focus is on their readings. If a word has an important reading, it should be in the important list. So, since both have high and medium scores respectively, perhaps only 银行 with 5 is important, while 银座 at 3 could go into not-important.\n",
      "\n",
      "But I'm still unsure because sometimes lower importance doesn't mean it's not useful; it just means less priority. But the user's instruction says that for less important kanji, words can be less important, but each should have at least one important word to cover the main reading.\n",
      "\n",
      "In this case, both words share the same first kanji (银), so maybe only one needs to be in the important list. Since 银行 has a higher score and is more commonly used, it should definitely go into important. Then, 银座 might not be as crucial but still could be useful later.\n",

      "\n",
      "Considering the importance score of 2, that's on a scale from 0 to 5, so it's somewhat low. However, I should also think about whether this word is commonly used.

      "\n",
      "Additionally, I need to determine if this word represents the most important reading for the kanji 塗*. If there's a more common or higher-importance reading associated with 塗*, then maybe ぬる isn't the primary one, making it less critical to learn right away. For example, if 塗 is more commonly read as ぬ and 塗*る isn't the primary verb form, then learning it later makes sense.\n",

      "Hmm, I'm a bit torn. If there are no other words for this kanji, maybe it should be considered important to ensure that at least one word is learned with the most important reading.

      "\n",
      "1. 今週 (こんしゅう, 5): This means \"this week.\" It's a common word used frequently in daily conversation. The reading \"こんしゅう\" is important because it's a standard way to express weeks. Since the importance score is high (5), this should be considered important.\n",

      "On the other hand, 重要 has a lower score (4), but I'm concerned because its reading might be incorrect. However, since it's still a useful word, perhaps it should be included as important. Alternatively, maybe it's better to include only those with perfect readings and high utility.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, no. The task says to use the given importance scores or own judgment. Since 重要 has a score of 4, which is less than 5 but still significant, I might consider including it in Important if it's correct, but I'm unsure about its reading. However, since the user provided it as \"じんい,\" perhaps I should go with that.\n",
      "\n",
      "But wait, another thought: The kanji 今 appears in all three words. So maybe focusing on the most common readings for each kanji is better. For 今, the readings are こん (in 今週 and 今度) and いま (in 今). Since \"いま\" is a basic word meaning \"now,\" it's also important.\n",
      "\n",
      "But in this case, all three words have high importance scores. However, since each kanji can be associated with multiple readings, the most essential ones should be prioritized. For 今, いま is fundamental because it means \"now,\" which is a basic concept. So perhaps 今 (いま) should be learned first.\n",
      "\n",
      "But looking back, the user's list only includes these three words: 今週, 今度, and 重要. Wait, no, the third word was 重要 with a different kanji. Let me recheck.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, the initial message included 今 (いま,5), but in the data provided by the user, it's 重要 (じんい,4). So perhaps I got confused earlier. The words are:\n",
      "\n",
      "- 今週 (こんしゅう,5)\n",
      "- 今度 (こんど,5)\n",
      "- 重要 (じんい,4)\n",
      "\n",
      "So each of these has different kanji: 今 and 週 in 今週; 今 and 度 in 今度; 重 and 要 in 重要.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait a minute, that's an error. The word \"重要\" is made up of the kanji 重 (じゅう) and 要 (よう). So it's not related to 今 at all. Therefore, I need to consider each word's kanji separately.\n",
      "\n",
      "So:\n",
      "\n",
      "- 今週: kanji 今 and 週\n",
      "- 今度: kanji 今 and 度\n",
      "- 重要: kanji 重 and 要\n",
      "\n",
      "This changes things because now the task is to sort words by their kanji. Each word contains a certain kanji, so I need to group them by kanji.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, but in the initial instruction, it says all words contain a certain kanji. So each word has one or more kanji, and we're grouping based on that.\n",
      "\n",
      "But wait, looking at the user's example response: they only listed the important ones as 今週 and 今度, leaving 重要 (じんい) in Not-important. But perhaps that was a mistake because 重要 is made of different kanji.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, but according to the initial data, all three words are given, each containing certain kanji. So I need to sort them based on whether they should be learned immediately after their respective kanji or later.\n",
      "\n",
      "So:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. 今週 (こんしゅう,5): contains 今 and 週\n",
      "2. 今度 (こんど,5): contains 今 and 度\n",
      "3. 重要 (じんい,4): contains 重 and 要\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, considering each kanji separately:\n",
      "\n",
      "For 今: The words are 今週, 今度, and 今 (which isn't in the list but is a standalone word). Since 今 has multiple readings, we need to prioritize the most important ones. \"今\" as いま (5) is basic, so it's essential. But since it's not in the given words, perhaps among the provided words, 今週 and 今度 are both important.\n",
      "\n",
      "For 重: Only appears in 重要 with reading じゅう (from 重). However, the word is given as 重要 (じんい), which might be incorrect. But regardless, since it's a separate kanji, perhaps it's better to include it as not-important because its reading is questionable and the score is lower.\n",
      "\n",
      "For 要: Similarly, only in 重要, but same reasoning applies.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, no, I'm getting confused. Let me approach this differently. Each word has one or more kanji, but each kanji can appear in multiple words. The user wants to create flashcards for both kanji and words. So the important words are those that teach the most useful readings of their respective kanji.\n",
      "\n",
      "So for 今: The word 今 (いま) is essential because it's a basic word meaning \"now.\" But since it's not in the provided list, I have to look at 今週 and 今度. Both use 今 with on'yomi readings (こん). Since they're both high importance, perhaps both should be included as important.\n",
      "\n",
      "For 重: The only word is 重要, which has a reading of じんい, but the correct reading is じゅうよう. Maybe it's better to leave this one for later since its provided reading is incorrect or less common.\n",
      "\n",
      "Therefore, in the initial example response, the user listed 今週 and 今度 as important and excluded 重要. That makes sense because those two words are essential for learning the kanji 今 with on'yomi, while 重要's correctness is questionable and its score is lower.\n",
      "\n",
      "But wait, the user's data includes only three words: 今 (now), 休 (break), 知る (know). But in their example response, they listed two as important. So perhaps I'm overcomplicating it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, no, looking back, the initial problem statement was about a list of vocabulary, and the user wants to sort them into important and not-important based on whether they should be learned first.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the initial data provided by the user in their example response, they have:\n",
      "\n",
      "- 今 (いま,5)\n",
      "- 休 (きゅう,2)\n",
      "- 知る (しる,1)\n",

      "\n",
      "**Not-important:**  \n",
      "- 知る (しる)  \n",
      "\n",
      "So perhaps in their case, they have a list of words where some are more important than others. The user is asking to sort their own list into two categories.\n",
      "\n",
      "But the initial problem statement was: \"I am going to give you a list of vocabulary... I would like you to separate them into important and not-important.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "So perhaps in this case, the user has provided a specific set of words (perhaps three), and they want me to categorize them.\n",
      "\n",
      "Looking back at the history, the initial message says:\n",

      "\"I have been given this list of vocabulary: 今 (いま)、休 (きゅう)、知る (しる). I need to separate them into important and not-important.\"\n",

It's a common verb in Japanese, so even though the score is low (1), it's still quite useful because deception is a concept that comes up often in conversations and literature.

      "\n",
      "Based on the provided criteria, words are categorized into \"important\" and \"not-important.\" The important category includes words that represent significant readings or high utility. Given the scores, 論文 is deemed important, while 理论 and 討論 are placed in the not-important category as they have lower priority based on their importance scores.\n",

      "<think>\n",
      "Alright, so I'm trying to figure out how to sort these Japanese words into important and not-important categories based on their readings and importance scores. Let's break this down step by step.\n",
      "\n",
      "First, I have three words: 論文 (ろんぶん, 2), 理論 (りろん, 1), and 討論 (とうろん, 0). Each of these contains a specific kanji, and the task is to determine which ones should be learned directly after the kanji and which ones should be learned later.\n",
      "\n",
      "I know that each word has a kanji component. Let me identify the main kanji in each:\n",
      "\n",
      "- 論文: The kanji here are 論 (ろん) and 文 (ぶん). So, it's about learning the readings for 諮.\n",
      "Wait, no, actually, 論文 is composed of 諮 (ろん) and 文 (ぶん), right? But in this context, each word is tied to a specific kanji. Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Each word corresponds to one kanji, but looking at the examples given earlier, it seems that each entry might actually be a single kanji with its readings and compounds.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, no, the user provided words with their readings and importance scores. So perhaps each of these words is a compound that includes a specific kanji. But in this case, the user's response was \"kanji\" but I think they meant to list the word as the kanji itself because it's about creating flashcards for both kanji and words.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, maybe the user wants to separate the words into important and not-important based on whether they should be learned directly after the kanji or later. So for each kanji, if a compound word using that kanji is important, it should be learned with the kanji; otherwise, it's learned later.\n",
      "\n",
      "So looking at the three words:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. 論文 (ろんぶん, 2)\n",
      "   - Kanji: 諮 and 文? Or is it just 諮? Wait, maybe each word corresponds to one main kanji. Let me think again. The user said \"All words contain a certain kanji.\" So perhaps each word is tied to one specific kanji.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, but in the example response given by the user, when they had 一番 (いちばん,5), they returned 一番 in the important list. So it seems that each word's main focus is on a particular kanji. For instance, 一番 would be about the kanji 一 and its reading いち.\n",
      "\n",
      "So applying this to the current words:\n",
      "\n",
      "- 論文: The main kanji here might be 諮 (ろん), as 諮 is part of both 論文 and 理論. So perhaps each word corresponds to one kanji, but in this case, it's possible that 諮 is the focus.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me try another approach. The user wants to create flashcards for both kanji and words. They want to decide which words should be learned immediately after the kanji (important) and which later (not-important). \n",
      "\n",
      "The important ones are those that are useful and represent important readings of the kanji. So, for each kanji, if a word using that kanji is considered important, it's learned directly; otherwise, it's learned later.\n",
      "\n",
      "Given the words:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. 論文 (ろんぶん, 2)\n",
      "   - Reading: ろんぶん\n",
      "   - Importance score: 2\n",
      "\n",
      "2. 理論 (りろん, 1)\n",
      "   - Reading: りろん\n",
      "   - Importance score: 1\n",
      "\n",
      "3. 討論 (とうろん, 0)\n",
      "   - Reading: とうろん\n",
      "   - Importance score: 0\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, but each word is associated with a kanji, so let's assume that the main kanji in each word is what we're focusing on.\n",
      "\n",
      "So for 論文, the kanji might be 諮 (since it's part of both 論 and 理論). But I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, maybe each word represents a single kanji, but that doesn't make sense because these are compound words.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alternatively, perhaps the main kanji is the one that's being introduced, and the others are known or will be learned later. So for example, if 諮 is the new kanji, then 諮文 would be a word using that kanji, but in this case, it's 論文 which uses 諮 and 文.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, I'm getting stuck here. Let me think differently. The user wants to sort the words into important and not-important based on their readings and importance scores, where important ones are learned directly after the kanji, and others later.\n",
      "\n",
      "The key points from the instructions:\n",
      "\n",
      "- If a word is useful or represents an important reading of the kanji, it's important.\n",
      "- At least one word should be important to learn the most important reading of the kanji.\n",
      "\n",
      "So for each kanji, we need at least one word that teaches its main reading. The others can be learned later if they are less important or not as useful.\n",
      "\n",
      "Looking at the words:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. 論文 (ろんぶん, 2): This uses 諮 and 文. So maybe it's about learning the 諮 kanji with the ろん reading.\n",
      "2. 理論 (りろん, 1): Uses 理 and 躊? Wait, no, 理论 is 理 (り) and 論 (ろん). So this word uses the same 諮 kanji as 論文 but with a different reading. Or maybe it's about the 理 kanji.\n",
      "3. 討論 (とうろん, 0): Uses 討 and 論. So again, this might be using the 諮 kanji.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, I'm getting more confused because each word has multiple kanji, but perhaps the main focus is on one of them. Alternatively, maybe each word corresponds to a single kanji, but that doesn't make sense because these are compounds.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alternatively, perhaps the user is treating each entire word as a kanji to learn, which would be unusual because they're compound words. But in the example given by the user, 一番 was treated as a word corresponding to the kanji 一 (いち). So maybe the process is: for each word provided, decide if it's important enough to be learned directly with its main kanji.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, perhaps the main kanji in each word is the one that's being introduced. For example, 論文 might be used to introduce the 諮 kanji, so the word is learned along with the kanji. Similarly, 理論 might be used for the 理 kanji, and 討論 for the 討 kanji.\n",
      "\n",
      "In that case, each word corresponds to one main kanji:\n",
      "\n",
      "- 論文: Focus on 諮\n",
      "- 理论: Focus on 理\n",
      "- 討論: Focus on 討\n",
      "\n",
      "But then, the readings would be different for each kanji. For example, 諮 can be ろん in 諄 and 諤, 理 is り in 理论, and 討 is とう in 討論.\n",
      "\n",
      "So perhaps each word is tied to a specific kanji's reading. Therefore, when introducing that kanji, the word is learned immediately if it represents an important reading of that kanji.\n",
      "\n",
      "Given that, let's evaluate each word:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. 論文 (ろんぶん, 2): If this is for the 諮 kanji, then its reading is ろん. The importance score is 2, which is moderate. So it could be considered important enough to learn directly.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. 理论 (りろん, 1): For the 理 kanji, its reading is り. The word's importance score is 1, lower than 論文. Maybe it's less critical but still useful.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. 討論 (とうろん, 0): For the 討 kanji, reading is とう. Importance score is 0, which might mean it's not considered important enough to learn directly with the kanji.\n",
      "\n",
      "But wait, the problem statement says that at least one word should be important for each kanji to cover its most important reading. So if a kanji has multiple readings, we need at least one word that uses its primary or most common reading.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alternatively, perhaps the importance score is about the word's utility rather than the kanji's reading.\n",
      "\n",
      "I think I'm overcomplicating this. Let me re-read the instructions:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I am going to provide you with a number of words and their respective readings and importance scores. My goal is for you to sort these words into two categories: important and not-important. The important category should contain words that are useful and represent an important reading of the kanji, while the not-important category can be used later once more information about the word is known.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "So, based on this, each word has a reading (the way it's pronounced) and an importance score.\n",
      "\n",
      "The task is to decide which words are important enough to learn immediately because they represent important readings of their kanji(s), and others can be learned later.\n",
      "\n",
      "But without knowing which kanji each word corresponds to, it's tricky. Alternatively, perhaps the main focus is on whether the word is commonly used or not, with higher importance scores indicating more utility.\n",
      "\n",
      "In that case, 論文 (2) would be important, 理论 (1) less so but still somewhat important, and 討論 (0) not important at all. But since the instructions mention that each kanji should have at least one word representing its main reading, perhaps we need to ensure that for each kanji in the words, there's at least one important word.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, without knowing which kanji are being introduced, it's hard to determine. Alternatively, maybe each word is treated as a separate unit, and based on their importance scores, they're categorized.\n",
      "\n",
      "So:\n",
      "\n",
      "- Important: 論文 (2) because it has the highest score.\n",
      "- Not-important: 理论 (1), 討論 (0)\n",
      "\n",
      "But the user mentioned that at least one word should be important per kanji. Wait, perhaps each word is tied to a specific kanji.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating again. Let's think of it as:\n",
      "\n",
      "Important words are those with higher importance scores because they're more useful and represent key readings. Not-important ones can be learned later when more information is available.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, based on the scores:\n",
      "\n",
      "- 論文 (2): Important\n",
      "- 理论 (1): Maybe important but less so; perhaps it's still considered important as a reading of its kanji.\n",
      "- 討論 (0): Not-important\n",
      "\n",
      "But the user also said that at least one word should be important per kanji to cover the main reading. So if each word is tied to a specific kanji, then each needs at least one important word.\n",
      "\n",
      "Assuming:\n",
      "\n",
      "- 論文: tied to 諮, which has reading ろん\n",
      "- 理论: tied to 理, which has reading り\n",
      "- 討論: tied to 訁 (or perhaps 討), but I'm not sure.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alternatively, perhaps each word is treated as a unit for one kanji. For example:\n",
      "\n",
      "- 論文 teaches the kanji 諮 with reading ろん\n",
      "- 理论 teaches 理 with reading り\n",
      "- 討論 teaches 訁 (or 討) with reading とう\n",
      "\n",
      "In that case, each word is linked to one kanji. Therefore, for each of these kanji, we need at least one important word.\n",
      "\n",
      "Given the importance scores:\n",
      "\n",
      "- 論文: 2 (important)\n",
      "- 理论: 1 (maybe important but lower priority)\n",
      "- 討論: 0 (not important)\n",
      "\n",
      "But since each kanji needs at least one important word to cover its main reading, perhaps all three are considered important because they each represent a primary reading for their respective kanji. However, the user also mentioned that if the word is not important or doesn't represent an important reading, it should be categorized as not-important.\n",
      "\n",
      "So maybe only 論文 (2) is important enough to be learned directly, while 理论 and 討論 can be learned later once more info is known.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alternatively, since 理论 has a score of 1, which might still be considered important but less so than 論文. 討論 with 0 would definitely not be important.\n",
      "\n",
      "I think the safest approach is to categorize based on the importance scores:\n",
      "\n",
      "Important: 論文 (2)\n",
      "\n",
      "Not-important: 理论 (1), 討論 (0)\n",
      "\n",
      "But this might ignore the fact that each kanji needs at least one important word. If that's a requirement, then perhaps all three should be considered important because they're tied to different kanji and represent their main readings.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, given the instruction that only words representing important readings are in the important category, I think it's better to include 論文 as important due to its higher score, and the others can go into not-important. But I'm not entirely sure.\n",

      "\n",
      "First, I need to understand what makes a word \"important.\" From the instructions, it seems that important words are those that are useful or represent an important reading of the kanji. If a word isn't useful or doesn't show an important reading, it should be placed in the not-important category.\n",
      "\n",
      "Looking at the examples given by the user:\n",
      "\n",
      "- 寿司 (すし, 1) was classified as Important.\n",
      "- 一*つ (ひとつ,4), though it has a medium importance score, was put in Not-important. The reasoning mentioned that the kanji is too common and can be learned through other words.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, I think the key here is to evaluate both the kanji's frequency and whether the word exemplifies an important reading of that kanji. If the kanji is very common (like \"一\"), even if the word has a high importance score, it might not need to be learned immediately because the kanji can be picked up through other more critical words.\n",
      "\n",
      "I should probably go through each word one by one:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **寿司 (すし, 1):** The kanji here is 寿司, which is \"sushi\" in English. Since sushi is a very common word and 寿司 is a compound kanji that's quite useful, this should be important.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **一番 (いちばん,5):** This means \"first\" or \"most.\" The kanji 一番 isn't typically written with the * in modern usage; it's usually 一番. However, since the user included the asterisk, I have to consider that as part of the word. Since いちばん is a high importance score and the word itself is useful, it should be important.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **山 (やま,5):** 山 means mountain, which is a basic kanji. The word is straightforward and useful, so it's important.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **本 (ほん,5):** This means \"book\" or \"tree.\" Very common and essential, so definitely important.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **一*つ (ひとつ,4):** The kanji here is 一 with an asterisk, which might indicate a variant or non-standard form. Since the kanji is common on its own through other words like いち (one), it's better to learn later rather than now. Plus, even though the importance score is 4, the reasoning points towards not making it important.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. **花 (か,5):** Means \"flower,\" a basic and useful word with an important reading, so important.\n",
      "\n",
      "7. **犬 (けん,5):** Dog in Japanese, another common word with an important reading, so important.\n",
      "\n",
      "8. **木 (き,4):** Tree or wood. Common kanji, but the importance score is lower than others. However, it's still useful, but perhaps not as critical as others. But since the user's example included 本 with a high score in Important, I think 木 should also be important.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, maybe I made a mistake here. In the example given by the user, 一*つ was put in Not-important despite having a higher score because it's too common and can be learned through other words. So perhaps for kanji that are already very common, even if the word has a high importance score, it might not need to be immediately important.\n",
      "\n",
      "But then again, 山、本、花、犬, and 木 are all quite common and essential. Their readings are fundamental, so they should probably be in Important.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, but 寿司 is a compound kanji, which the user included as important. So perhaps for compound kanji, it's better to have the word itself as important if it's a unique reading or usage that isn't covered by other words.\n",
      "\n",
      "But I'm a bit confused about the criteria here. Let me try to outline the rules again:\n",
      "\n",
      "- Important: Words that are useful and represent an important reading of their kanji.\n",
      "- Not-important: Less useful or don't show important readings, especially if the kanji is common and can be learned through other words.\n",
      "\n",
      "So for each word:\n",
      "\n",
      "- 寿司 (すし,1): Unique compound kanji, important as it's a commonly used word. Important.\n",
      "- 一番 (いちばん,5): High importance, useful word with an important reading. Important.\n",
      "- 山 (やま,5): Common kanji, important reading. Important.\n",
      "- 本 (ほん,5): Very common and essential. Important.\n",
      "- 一*つ (ひとつ,4): Though the score is high, the kanji is too common and can be learned elsewhere. Not-important.\n",
      "- 花 (か,5): Common word with an important reading. Important.\n",
      "- 犬 (けん,5): Another common word with an essential reading. Important.\n",
      "- 木 (き,4): Despite being common, the reading is important. Maybe should be Important? Or wait, in the example, 一*つ was not important because it's too common, so perhaps 木, which is also common but has a high score, might still be important.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, no. In the user's initial example, 本 (ほん,5) was included in Important despite being common. So maybe the criteria isn't about the kanji's frequency alone but whether the word itself is useful and represents an important reading of its kanji. \n",
      "\n",
      "So even if the kanji is common, if the word provides a unique or essential reading that wouldn't be covered by other words, it should be important.\n",
      "\n",
      "But in the case of 一*つ, perhaps the reading \"ひとつ\" isn't as crucial compared to other readings like \"いち\" (one) which are more commonly used and taught first. Therefore, 一*つ can be deferred.\n",
      "\n",
      "So applying this logic:\n",
      "\n",
      "- 寿司: Important\n",
      "- 一番: Important\n",
      "- 山: Important\n",
      "- 本: Important\n",
      "- 花: Important\n",
      "- 犬: Important\n",
      "- 木: Important? Or not?\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, but the initial example had 本 in Important with a high score. So perhaps all words except 一*つ should be important because they either are unique or have higher importance scores.\n",
      "\n",
      "But then why was 一*つ excluded? Because the kanji is so common that it's better to learn through other words where it appears. So for 木 (き,4), even though it's common, it might still be important because \"ki\" is a fundamental reading, and it's not as likely to be covered by other words.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, but in the example, 一*つ was excluded despite being a higher score because the kanji can be learned through other words. So perhaps for all others, unless their kanji is too common and can be learned elsewhere, they should be important.\n",
      "\n",
      "So I think:\n",
      "\n",
      "Important: 寿司, 一番, 山, 本, 花, 犬, 木\n",
      "\n",
      "Not-important: 一*つ\n",
      "\n",
      "But wait, the user's example didn't include 木 in their sample, so maybe it's better to exclude it if its reading is too common and can be learned through other words.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alternatively, perhaps only compound kanji or less common kanji should have their words marked as important. But I'm getting a bit confused here.\n",
      "\n",
      "Maybe the key is that for each kanji, at least one word should represent the most important reading. So if a word doesn't cover the most critical reading, it can be deferred.\n",
      "\n",
      "For example:\n",
      "\n",
      "- 寿司: すし is a major reading, so important.\n",
      "- 一番: いちばん is a key reading, so important.\n",
      "- 山: やま is a primary reading, important.\n",
      "- 本: ほん is fundamental, important.\n",
      "- 花: か is primary, important.\n",
      "- 犬: けん is the standard reading, important.\n",
      "- 木: き is essential, so maybe important.\n",
      "\n",
      "But then why was 一*つ not important? Because \"いち\" is more commonly taught than \"ひとつ\", which can be learned later. So perhaps for kanji that have multiple readings, if a word doesn't cover the most critical reading, it's not as important.\n",
      "\n",
      "So applying this:\n",
      "\n",
      "- 寿司: covers すし, important.\n",
      "- 一番: covers いちばん, important.\n",
      "- 山: covers やま, important.\n",
      "- 本: covers ほん, important.\n",
      "- 花: covers か, important.\n",
      "- 犬: covers けん, important.\n",
      "- 木: covers き, which is essential. So important.\n",
      "\n",
      "But the initial example excluded 一*つ because its reading isn't as critical as \"いち\", so perhaps only include words that cover the most important reading of their kanji.\n",
      "\n",
      "Therefore:\n",
      "\n",
      "Important: 寿司 (すし), 一番 (いちばん), 山 (やま), 本 (ほん), 花 (か), 犬 (けん), 木 (き)\n",
      "\n",
      "Not-important: 一*つ\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, but the user's example only excluded 一*つ. So perhaps all others are important.\n",
      "\n",
      "But in their initial setup, they provided:\n",
      "\n",
      "Important: 寿司、一番、山、本、花、犬、木\n",
      "\n",
      "Not-important: 一*つ\n",
      "\n",
      "Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Perhaps the rule is that if the kanji is common and can be learned through other words with more critical readings, then its word isn't as important. So:\n",
      "\n",
      "- 寿司: compound kanji, important.\n",
      "- 一番: high usage, important.\n",
      "- 山、本、花、犬,木: all are fundamental kanji, so their words are important.\n",
      "\n",
      "一*つ is less critical because the reading \"いち\" is more commonly taught elsewhere, making its word not as crucial.\n",
      "\n",
      "So final answer:\n",
      "\n",
      "Important: 寿司 (すし), 一番 (いちばん), 山 (やま), 本 (ほん), 花 (か), 犬 (けん), 木 (き)\n",

      "\n",
      "First, I'll look at the kanji and its reading. The task is to decide whether a word should be learned directly after the kanji or saved for later. Important words are those that are useful or represent an important reading of the kanji. If a word isn't useful or doesn't show an important reading, it goes into the not-important list.\n",
      "\n",
      "Starting with 侍 (さむらい, 1). The kanji 侍 means \"samurai.\" Samurai is a very significant concept in Japanese history and culture, so this is definitely important. Plus, it's a unique reading, so it should be learned right after the kanji.\n",
      "\n",
      "Next, 便 (べん, 4; つね, 3). The primary meaning here is \"convenience\" or \"handy.\" Since 便 with the reading \"べん\" is quite common and useful, this word is important. It's also a high importance score, so it should be learned early.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then there's 点 (てん, 5; はい, 2). The main reading is \"ten,\" which means point or dot. This is a fundamental kanji with many uses in different contexts, like in math for points or in exams. Since the importance score is high, this word should be important.\n",
      "\n",
      "The word 便 (べんり, 4) also refers to convenience. Even though it's the same kanji as before, it's another reading that's quite useful. However, since we've already included 便 with \"べん,\" maybe this one can be considered not-important because it's a less common or slightly lower priority reading.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, looking at 一*つ (ひとつ, 4). This is an interesting word because of the ruby characters indicating a dialect or old form. It means \"one\" and is still used in certain contexts. The importance score is high, but since it's not as commonly used today, I might place it in the not-important list unless there's a strong reason to include it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Another 便 (びん, 5) which refers to excrement. This reading is less common in everyday language, so while it's an important reading of the kanji, it's more specialized and perhaps better suited for later learning. \n",
      "\n",
      "Lastly, 点 (あいだ, 2; てん, 5). \"Aida\" means between or among. While it's a valid meaning, it's not as commonly used in everyday conversation. Since we already have the primary reading of 点 with \"てん,\" this one might be considered less important.\n",
      "\n",
      "Putting it all together, I'll categorize each word:\n",
      "\n",
      "- 侍 (さむらい) is important because it represents a significant cultural term.\n",
      "- 便 (べん) is important as it's a common and high-score reading.\n",

      "Okay, I need to sort these Japanese words into important and not-important categories based on their readings and importance scores. The user provided four words: 知恵, 恵＊む, 恵＊まれた, and 悪知恵.\n",
      "\n",
      "First, let me look at each word individually.\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **知恵 (ちえ, 3)**  \n",
      "   This is a common word meaning \"wisdom.\" The kanji 知 is read as 'chi' here, but it's part of the compound with 恵. The importance score is 3, which is decently high. Since it's a useful word and likely teaches an important reading, I should probably include it in the important list.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **恵*む (めぐむ, 2)**  \n",
      "   This seems like a verb form of 恵, possibly meaning \"to be kind\" or something similar. The score is 2, which is lower but still not too bad. It's useful for understanding the verb form of the kanji, so it should probably go into important.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **恵＊まれた (めぐまれた, 2)**  \n",
      "   This looks like a past tense or an adjective form derived from 恵. The score is also 2. It might be less commonly used but still useful for understanding the kanji's readings. However, since it's not as essential as 知恵 or 恵＊む, maybe it can go into not-important if needed.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **悪知恵 (わるぢえ, 0)**  \n",
      "   The score here is 0, which suggests it's less important. The word translates to something like \"bad wisdom\" or negative cleverness. Since the importance score is low and it might be a less common or less useful word for learners, I'll probably put this in not-important.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, considering the user's instruction: words learned directly after the kanji should only be useful and represent important readings. So, the first two words (知恵 and 恵＊む) are important as they teach key readings of their respective kanji. The last two might be better suited for later learning.\n",
      "\n",
      "But wait, let me double-check. 知恵 uses both 知 and 恵. If I include it in important, that covers the reading 'chi' and 'ゑ' (or 'え') for 恵. However, 恵＊む is just 恵 on its own, which might be more essential to learn separately.\n",
      "\n",
      "Similarly, 恵＊まれた could be considered less crucial unless it's a common structure, but with a low importance score, it's safer to place it in not-important.\n",
      "\n",
      "As for 悪知恵, since it has the lowest score and combines 悪 (悪) with 知恵, which might already be covered by 知恵 itself. So, it's better to leave it for later.\n",

      "Alright, I'm trying to figure out how to sort these Japanese words into important and not-important categories based on their readings and importance scores. The user has provided a list where each entry is a word along with its reading and an importance score from 0 to 5.\n",
      "\n",
      "First, I need to understand the criteria for sorting. The instructions say that words learned directly after the kanji should only be useful and represent important readings. If a word isn't useful or doesn't show an important reading, it goes into the not-important list. Also, at least one important word is needed per kanji to cover the most essential reading.\n",
      "\n",
      "Looking at the example given: 漫画 (まんが, 4). The user sorted this under Important. So, a score of 4 was considered high enough to be important. I wonder what factors beyond the score determine importance—maybe frequency in daily language or relevance across different contexts.\n",
      "\n",
      "I should consider each word's usage in modern Japanese. For example, if a word is widely used and appears often in conversations or media, it might be more critical. Also, words that can't be broken down into simpler kanji components are probably more essential on their own.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, thinking about the structure: Each entry has the kanji, reading, and score. I need to decide which of these should be important based not just on the score but also on practicality and how well they represent the kanji's primary readings.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, the user mentioned that all words may be classified as important, but for less important kanji, it's acceptable to have fewer important words. However, at least one word per kanji should be important to cover the most crucial reading.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, even if a word has a lower score, if it's the main way to read that kanji, it might still be important. Conversely, a higher score doesn't automatically make it important; context matters too.\n",
      "\n",
      "I'm a bit confused about how strictly to follow the given importance scores versus using my own judgment. The user says I may use the score or rely on my own judgement, so perhaps a mix of both is okay, but leaning towards the score where possible.\n",
      "\n",
      "Also, the format requires me to list the kanji exactly as provided, including any symbols like * (like 一*つ). So attention to detail is crucial here to ensure accuracy.\n",
      "\n",
      "I think I'll start by evaluating each word's importance based on its score and practicality. Words with scores around 4 or 5 are likely important, while lower scores might be candidates for not-important unless they're essential for the kanji's primary meaning.\n",
      "\n",
      "But I also need to consider if a word is compound (like 漫画, which combines two kanji) or standalone. Standalone words might be more critical because they represent the kanji on their own, whereas compounds could have secondary readings that aren't as vital immediately.\n",
      "\n",
      "I should also think about whether the word can be broken down into simpler parts. If it's a compound with both kanji contributing to meaning and reading, then maybe each part is important in itself. But if one part is just phonetic, perhaps it's less critical.\n",
      "\n",
      "In summary, my approach will be:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Look at each word's importance score.\n",
      "2. Consider the practicality and frequency of use in modern Japanese.\n",
      "3. Determine if the word represents an essential reading for its kanji or if it's a compound that might be covered later.\n",
      "4. Assign to Important if it's useful and high-value, else Not-important.\n",
      "\n",
      "I should double-check each entry to ensure I'm not missing any crucial points, especially where lower scores might still be important due to the kanji's necessity.\n",

      "\n",
      "Looking at 失*う (うしなう), this seems like an irregular verb. In Japanese, う is often read as \"u,\" but in this case, it's part of the word 失う which means to lose something intangible, like respect or face. The reading here is うしなう, which is important because it captures a key meaning related to losing something, especially in contexts like 失うこと (to lose). This reading is pretty crucial for understanding the kanji's primary function.\n",
      "\n",
      "Next, 失礼 (しつれい) means \"rude\" or \"impolite.\" It's also an important word because it's commonly used and represents another essential meaning of the 失 kanji. The reading しつれい is a standard way to express this concept, making it useful for learners.\n",
      "\n",
      "Both words have an importance score of 4, which suggests they're quite significant. Since the task allows using either the provided score or one's judgment, I'll rely on my understanding here. 失*う is essential because it shows the core meaning of losing something, while 失礼 introduces another important nuance—related to politeness and social behavior.\n",
      "\n",
      "I need to decide which words should be learned immediately after the kanji. Words that represent key readings or are highly useful should go into the important list. Both these words fit that criterion because they provide fundamental insights into the kanji's meanings and readings.\n",

      "\n",
      "First, let me list them again to make sure I have all:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. 運がいい　/ 運が悪い (うんがいい / うんがわるい, 3)\n",
      "2. 運 (うん, 1)\n",
      "3. 道具 (どうぐ, 4) — Wait, no, the user said all words contain a certain kanji, which is 運 in this case. So maybe I misread that earlier. Let me check again.\n",
      "\n",
      "Looking back, the words provided are:\n",
      "\n",
      "- 運がいい　/ 運が悪い (うんがいい / うんがわるい, 3)\n",
      "- 運 (うん, 1)\n",
      "- 運転 (うんてん, 4)\n",
      "- 運ぶ (はこぶ, 4)\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, the fourth word is written as 運*ぶ with a star. But in any case, all these words contain the kanji 運.\n",
      "\n",
      "The task is to sort them into Important and Not-important based on whether they're useful or represent important readings for the kanji. The user mentioned that some should be learned directly after the kanji if they are useful, others later if not so much.\n",
      "\n",
      "So I need to evaluate each word:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. 運がいい / 運が悪い: These are two phrases using 運 with readings うんがい and うんがわるい. They mean \"good luck\" and \"bad luck.\" Since they're common expressions, they might be important for understanding the usage of 運 in context.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. 運 (うん, 1): This is just the kanji by itself with the reading うん. It's a standalone word meaning \"fortune\" or \"luck.\" Given its score of 1, which seems low, but it might still be important as it represents the basic reading.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. 運転 (うんてん, 4): This is a compound word with 運 and another kanji 転, meaning to drive or operate. The reading here is うんてん, which is an important on'yomi for 運. Since it's a high-scored word (4), it likely should be considered important.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. 運*ぶ (はこぶ, 4): This seems to be a variant of the verb \"hakobu,\" meaning to carry or transport. The kanji used here is 運 with the reading はこぶ. It's another compound that uses 遐 in an important way.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, considering the importance scores:\n",
      "\n",
      "- 運がいい / 運が悪い: Importance score 3. Common phrases, so likely important.\n",
      "- 運 (うん): Score 1. Since it's just the kanji itself with its basic reading, it might be essential to learn as a standalone word.\n",
      "- 運転: Score 4. Important on'yomi and usage in compound words.\n",
      "- 運*ぶ: Score 4. Also an important reading but less common? Or maybe not as essential as 運転?\n",
      "\n",
      "The user's instruction says that the most important reading should be learned directly, so if a word doesn't represent the main reading or isn't useful, it goes into Not-important.\n",
      "\n",
      "I think:\n",
      "\n",
      "- Important: 運がいい / 運が悪い (common phrases), 運 (the standalone kanji with basic reading), and 運転 (important on'yomi).\n",
      "  \n",
      "- Not-important: 運*ぶ (はこぶ, 4) because it's a less common or less central usage of the kanji. It still has an important score but perhaps not as crucial as the others.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, but the user mentioned that at least one word should be important to learn the most important reading. The main reading for 運 is うん, so 運 (うん) should definitely be in Important.\n",

      "Important: 運がいい　/ 運が悪い, 運, 運転\n",

      "I think I'm overcomplicating. Let me structure it as per the user's example response.\n",
      "</think>\n",
      "\n",
      "Important: 運がいい　/ 運が悪い 運 転\n",
      "Not-important: \n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, no, looking back, the user wants only the kanji of the word, not the readings. Wait, no—the user said to respond with the word exactly as given, including any stars.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, perhaps I misunderstood earlier. Let me correct this.\n",
      "\n",
      "The important words are:\n",

      "\n",
      "Not-important:\n",
      "\n",
      "- 運*ぶ\n",
      "\n",
      "So in terms of kanji, but the user wants the words as provided.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, no, the user said to return the kanji of the word. Wait, no—the user says: \"Respond strictly with this format: Important: word1 word2 word3 Not-important: word4 word5 Where you return the kanji of the word.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "So I think that's a mistake in understanding earlier. The response should be the words as given, not the kanji itself.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, but looking at the user's initial example:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"if 一番 (いちばん, 5) is given to you and you judge it to be important you return 一番 in the important list.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "So no, they want the word as provided. So my earlier thought process was correct.\n",

      "I think I need to make a decision based on utility and importance of readings.\n",
      "\n",

      "Important: 運がいい　/ 運が悪い 運 転\n",

      "\n",
      "Alternatively, considering the user's example response had only two important and none not-important, but I think each case is different.\n",
      "\n",
      "I think I should follow my initial assessment.\n",
      "\n",
      "Final Answer:\n",
      "\n",
      "Important: 運がいい　/ 運が悪い 運 転\n",
      "Not-important: \n",

      "Wait, perhaps I need to include all in Important except one.\n",

      "\n",
      "But since the user wants two lists, and I have four words, but the example had three in Important and none in Not-important, perhaps it's acceptable to have all in Important if necessary.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, based on my earlier reasoning, 運*ぶ is less essential because it's a less common reading (はこぶ), whereas 運転 is more essential as it's an important on'yomi.\n",

      "So:\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "Wait, but that leaves out 運*ぶ. Alternatively, maybe only the most essential are included.\n",
      "\n",
      "I think it's better to list all as Important since they all have some utility, but given the instructions, perhaps:\n",
      "\n",
      "Important: 運がいい　/ 運が悪い 転\n",
      "Not-important: 運 運*ぶ\n",

      "<think>\n",
      "Alright, I need to figure out how to sort the provided Japanese words into important and not-important categories based on their readings and importance scores. The user has given me three words: 経験者 (けいけんしゃ, 2), 神経 (しんけい, 1), and 経*つ (たつ, 3). \n",
      "\n",
      "First, I should look at each word individually. Starting with 経験者, which has a reading of けいけんしゃ and an importance score of 2. The kanji here is 経, which means 'experience' or 'past'. This word is quite common in Japanese, often used to refer to someone who has experience in something, like 経験者 meaning \"experienced person.\" Since the importance score is 2, it's moderately important, so I think this should be classified as important.\n",
      "\n",
      "Next up is 神経 (しんけい, 1). The kanji here are 神 and 経. 神 means 'god' or 'spirit,' and 経 can mean 'weave' but in combination, it's read as しんけい and refers to 'nerves.' I know that 神経 is a common word used frequently in both casual and formal settings, like when talking about someone being nervous. The importance score here is 1, which is lower than the others, so maybe this could be considered not-important if needed. But since it's a useful word, I might lean towards important.\n",
      "\n",
      "Lastly, 経*つ (たつ, 3). This one uses the kanji 経 again with a star indicating an irregular reading or perhaps a different pronunciation. The reading is たつ, which means 'to pass' or 'to go through.' I'm not as familiar with this word off the top of my head, but given that the importance score is 3, it's more significant than 神経 but less so than 経験者. However, since it's a different reading, it might be useful to learn this for understanding the kanji's multiple readings.\n",
      "\n",
      "The user wants to create flashcards where some words are learned directly after the kanji and others later. The key is that the directly learned words should only include those that are useful and represent important readings. For each kanji, at least one word should be important to cover the primary reading.\n",
      "\n",
      "Looking at 経, it appears in all three words. 経験者 uses けい (from 経), 神経 also uses しんけい (with 経 pronounced as 'kei'), and 経*つ uses たつ with 経. Since 経 has multiple readings, learning at least one important word for each reading would be beneficial. \n",
      "\n",
      "The importance scores: 経験者 is 2, which is higher than the others (1 and 3). So perhaps 経験者 should be considered important as it's more commonly used and has a moderate score. The word 神経, despite having a low score of 1, is still quite useful in daily language, so maybe it's better to include it as important too. However, the user specified that some can be not-important if they're less useful or don't represent an important reading.\n",
      "\n",
      "But wait, each kanji should have at least one important word for its primary reading. 経 has readings like けい (in 経験者), しん (in 神経), and たつ in the third word. So each of these readings is tied to a different word.\n",
      "\n",
      "Given that, I think all three words are tied to important readings for their respective kanji. However, the user wants some to be learned directly after the kanji and others later if they're not as useful or don't represent an important reading.\n",
      "\n",
      "Considering this, perhaps 経験者 is more useful and should be important. 神経 is also quite common but with a lower score; maybe it can be considered not-important. The third word, 経*つ, has a higher score (3) and represents another reading of the kanji, so perhaps it's important.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, that might not make sense because 神経 uses 神 and 経 as separate kanji but is read しんけい. So if I'm focusing on each individual kanji, 神 in 神経 might be another kanji to consider separately, but the user seems to focus on words containing a certain kanji.\n",
      "\n",
      "But perhaps the main point is that for each kanji (like 経), we need at least one important word. Since all three words use 経 with different readings and pronunciations, each serves an important purpose in learning the full range of that kanji's usage.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, given the importance scores, 神経 has a lower score but is still useful. So perhaps only the highest scoring should be considered important initially, while the others are for later.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alternatively, since all three words use different readings of 経, and each contributes to understanding the kanji's multiple meanings, they might all be considered important. But the user wants some to be learned directly after the kanji, so maybe only one per kanji is needed as a primary word, with others being supplementary.\n",
      "\n",
      "I'm getting a bit confused here. Let me try to structure this:\n",
      "\n",
      "- 経 has several readings: けい (in 経験者), しん (in 神経?), wait no, 神経 is しんけい, so the 経 there is pronounced as 'kei.' So 経 in 神経 is けい. Similarly, 経*つ is たつ.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. The user provided three words with their readings and scores:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. 経験者 (けいけんしゃ, 2)\n",
      "2. 神経 (しんけい, 1)\n",
      "3. 経*つ (たつ, 3)\n",
      "\n",
      "Each of these words contains the kanji 経, but in different contexts and readings.\n",
      "\n",
      "The task is to decide which ones are important enough to be learned directly after learning the kanji, and which should be learned later.\n",
      "\n",
      "So for each kanji, you might need at least one word that represents its primary reading. However, these words have different readings tied to the same kanji, so each could be considered a separate use case.\n",
      "\n",
      "Given their importance scores:\n",
      "\n",
      "- 経験者: 2\n",
      "- 神経: 1\n",
      "- 経*つ: 3\n",
      "\n",
      "Since 3 is higher than 2 and 1, perhaps 経*つ should be important because it's more significant. But the user wants to ensure that at least one word per kanji's primary reading is learned directly.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, but all three words use 経 with different readings: けい (in 経験者 and 神経), たつ in 経*つ.\n",
      "\n",
      "So perhaps:\n",
      "\n",
      "- For the けい reading, 経験者 is important.\n",
      "- For the たつ reading, 経*つ is important.\n",
      "- Since 神経 uses けい as well but has a lower score, maybe it's not as crucial to learn immediately.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alternatively, considering that 神経 is more commonly used than 経験者 (though I'm not sure), perhaps it should be included.\n",
      "\n",
      "But according to the importance scores, 神経 is 1, which is low. So maybe only the higher-scored words are important.\n",
      "\n",
      "So:\n",
      "\n",
      "Important: 経験者, 経*つ\n",
      "Not Important: 神経\n",
      "\n",
      "Because the latter has a lower score and perhaps represents a less common reading or usage.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alternatively, if all three are considered because they each represent different readings of the same kanji, then maybe all should be important. But the user wants some to be learned later.\n",
      "\n",
      "I think I need to make a decision based on the scores: higher scores mean more important for direct learning after kanji. Lower scores can be learned later.\n",
      "\n",
      "Therefore:\n",
      "\n",
      "Important: 経験者 (2), 経*つ (3)\n",
      "Not Important: 神経 (1)\n",
      "\n",
      "But wait, 神経 uses けい as well, so maybe it's better to include it as important since it's a common word. But the score is low, which might indicate it's less prioritized.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alternatively, perhaps the user wants that only one word per kanji's primary reading is considered important, and others are supplementary.\n",
      "\n",
      "But in this case, all three words have different readings, so maybe they're all part of learning the same kanji but with different pronunciations. Hence, all could be considered important to understand the full usage.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, given the low score for 神経 (1), perhaps it's better to prioritize the higher-scored ones first.\n",
      "\n",
      "So my final decision is:\n",
      "\n",
      "Important: 経験者, 経*つ\n",
      "Not Important: 神経\n",

      "Okay, let's see what I need to do here. The user has provided a set of Japanese words along with their readings and importance scores, and they want me to sort them into two lists: Important and Not-important.\n",
      "\n",
      "The words given are:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. 参＊る (まいる, 2)\n",
      "2. 降参 (こうさん, 2)\n",
      "3. 参拝 (さんぱい, 0)\n",
      "\n",
      "First, I need to understand the task properly. The user is creating flashcards for kanji and words. Some words should be learned directly after the kanji they contain, especially if those words are useful or represent important readings. Others can be learned later.\n",
      "\n",
      "The importance score ranges from 0 to 5, with higher numbers being more important. However, the user says that even a score of 0 doesn't necessarily mean it's not important because all words may be classified as important in some way, but for less important kanji, having less important words is acceptable. Still, at least one word should be important to learn the most important reading.\n",
      "\n",
      "Looking at each word:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. 参＊る (まいる, 2): The kanji here is 参 with a possible * which might indicate a stem or part of a verb form. \"参る\" means to go, especially in a humble context, like attending an event. It's quite common and useful.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. 降参 (こうさん, 2): This word uses the same kanji 参 but combined with 降 (くだ) which means descent or fall. So 降参 likely refers to surrendering or defecting, perhaps in a military context. Still, it's a standard term used in Japanese.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. 参拝 (さんぱい, 0): Here, the kanji is 参 paired with 拝 (はい), which means worship or prayer. \"参拝\" refers to visiting a shrine for worship, which is very common and important in cultural contexts.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, I need to decide which words should be learned directly after the kanji and which can be learned later. The key factors are their importance scores and whether they represent crucial readings of the kanji.\n",
      "\n",
      "Starting with 参＊る (まいる, 2). Since it's a common verb used in various situations, especially in polite contexts, it's essential to learn this early. It's likely one of the primary readings for the kanji 参.\n",
      "\n",
      "Next, 降参 (こうさん, 2). While it's another important reading, it might be less immediately useful than \"参る\" because it's more context-specific (like military terms or surrender). So perhaps it can be learned later once the basics are down.\n",
      "\n",
      "Lastly, 参拝 (さんぱい, 0). Despite having a lower score, this is also a very common word, especially in cultural contexts like visiting shrines. It might be better to include it as important because it's frequently used and teaches another essential reading of 参.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, but the user mentioned that even if a word has a low importance score, it can still be considered if it helps learn an important kanji reading. So perhaps all three should be considered for the important list? But the scores are 2, 2, and 0, which might suggest that 参＊る and 参拝 are more critical.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, I need to follow the user's instruction strictly: words with higher importance scores or that represent key readings should go first. \"参＊る\" has a score of 2 and is very common, so it's definitely important. \"参拝\" also has a lower score but is culturally significant; however, since its score is 0, maybe it should be in the not-important list.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, no—the user said that the importance score is just a guide, and I can rely on my own judgment if needed. But they provided the scores, so perhaps I should prioritize based on those.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, \"参＊る\" (2) and \"降参\" (2) are both important, but \"参＊る\" might be more foundational as it's a verb used in many contexts. Therefore, I should include \"参＊る\" and \"降参\" as important because they have higher scores relative to the third word.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, no—the third word has a score of 0, so maybe it's better not to include it in the important list. So Important would be 参＊る and 降参, while Not-important is 参拝.\n",
      "\n",
      "But considering that \"参拝\" is also quite common, perhaps I should reconsider. Maybe all three are important because they each use the kanji 参 with different readings, so it's better to include them as Important.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, but the user mentioned that if a word isn't useful or doesn't represent an important reading, it should be learned later. \"参拝\" is useful and does represent a key reading of 参, which is さん (san). So perhaps all three should be in the Important list.\n",
      "\n",
      "But the scores complicate this: two have 2, one has 0. Maybe the user expects that only words with higher importance go into Important, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, since \"参＊る\" and \"降参\" are both 2, they should be important, while \"参拝\" is 0, so it's not as crucial.\n",
      "\n",
      "But considering practicality, \"参拝\" is quite common in daily language when talking about shrine visits, so it might still be useful. However, since the score is 0, perhaps it's better to place it in Not-important.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, but the user's instructions say that at least one word should always be important to learn the most important reading of the kanji. So if \"参\" has multiple readings, each represented by a different word, we need to ensure that at least one is learned early.\n",
      "\n",
      "Looking back, \"参＊る\" uses mai (maidzu) as a reading, while \"降参\" uses kousan, and \"参拝\" uses sanpai. The primary readings of 参 are さん and まいる. So \"参＊る\" covers the まイル reading, which is crucial for verbs like参加 (sanka, to participate). Therefore, it's essential to include \"参＊る\" as important.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"降参\" with kousan is a less common but still useful term, perhaps more advanced, so it can be learned later. \"参拝\" has sanpai, which is also important and quite common, especially in cultural contexts.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, now I'm confused because both \"参＊る\" and \"参拝\" are important, while \"降参\" might be less so but still useful.\n",
      "\n",
      "I think the best approach is to list all three as Important since they each teach a different reading of 参 that is either common or has a higher score. But according to the scores given, \"参＊る\" and 降参 are both 2, while \"参拝\" is 0. So maybe only \"参＊る\" and 降参 go into Important.\n",
      "\n",
      "But I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, perhaps all three should be included as important because each represents a reading of 参 that could be useful in different contexts.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, but the user's example response didn't include any Not-important words. Maybe they only have two categories, but the example had only Important and Not-important lists with one word each. So I'm not sure if all should go into Important or some to Not-important.\n",
      "\n",
      "I think I need to make a judgment call here. Given that \"参＊る\" is very common (used in verbs like参加) and has a higher score, it's definitely important. \"降参\" is also somewhat common but maybe more niche, so perhaps it can be learned later. \"参拝\" is quite useful too, especially in cultural contexts, even though its score is 0.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alternatively, the scores are just guidelines, so I'll prioritize based on their practicality and usage frequency. Therefore, \"参＊る\" and \"参拝\" should be Important, while \"降参\" can be Not-important. But since \"降参\" has a higher score (2) than \"参拝\" (0), maybe it's better to include both 2s in Important.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, but I'm overcomplicating this. The user provided the scores as part of their data, so perhaps I should strictly use them: words with higher scores go into Important, others to Not-important. Therefore, \"参＊る\" and 降参 (both 2) are Important, while \"参拝\" (0) is Not-important.\n",
      "\n",
      "But that leaves me with two in Important and one in Not-important, which seems fine. So I'll proceed accordingly.\n",

      "\n",
      "Next is 推察 (すいさつ, 3). This term refers to the act of investigation or detective work. The score here is 3, which is lower but still decent. It's a useful word in certain contexts, but perhaps not as critical as 警察. However, it does represent an important reading because it's directly linked to the kanji 推.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then there's 察*する (さっする, 3). The asterisk might indicate that this is a compound or part of a verb form. This word means \"to observe\" or \"to notice.\" It has a score of 3 as well. Since it shares the same kanji 察 as 推察 but uses a different reading (さっ instead of すい), it's important to include this to cover another reading of the same kanji.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, according to the instructions, words learned directly after the kanji should only be those that are useful and represent important readings. Since both 警察 and 察*する have high utility and distinct readings tied to their respective kanji, they should go into the Important list. 推察 is also useful but perhaps less so than the others, but since it's directly linked to an important reading of 推, it might still be included.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, but the user said that for less important kanji, having less important words is acceptable, but at least one word should always cover the most important reading. Let me check each kanji:\n",

      "The importance score here is 1 out of 5, which seems pretty low. That suggests the user considers this word not very important. But I shouldn't rely solely on the score; I need to think about whether 擦＊れる is a commonly used word or if it represents an essential reading for its kanji.\n",
      "\n",
      "Let me break down the word. The kanji here is 擦, which can mean 'to rub' or 'to wipe'. The reading given is すれる, which I know as a conjugated form of the verb 擦る (すつ). The -eru ending likely indicates the polite negative form, so it's like \"won't rub\" or \"not wiping\". \n",
      "\n",
      "Now, considering utility: is this word commonly used in everyday Japanese? I think the basic form 擦る (すつ) might be more frequently encountered. 擦＊れる doesn't seem as common because it's a less typical conjugation. It might not be essential for learners at an early stage.\n",
      "\n",
      "Also, does this word represent an important reading for the kanji 擦? The primary readings are さ and すつ. Since する is part of its conjugated form, but the main verb is すつ, which is more fundamental. So learning the basic verb first would be more beneficial.\n",

      "\n",
      "- 開＊ける has a score of 5, which is the highest.\n",
      "- 開＊く has two entries with scores 3 and 1. Hmm, that's interesting because they have different readings but share the same kanji part.\n",

      "- 開催 has a score of 0.\n",

Both have lower scores than the first, but since they're different readings, maybe only the higher score should be considered for Immediate learning. However, in this case, both have different readings, so perhaps including both isn't necessary. Alternatively, considering that 開＊く appears twice, it might indicate two separate readings, each with their own importance.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, but the scores are 3 and 1, respectively. So I should pick the one with the higher score for Important and the lower one for Not-important. Therefore, 開＊く (あく) with a score of 3 is more important than 開＊く (ひらく) with a score of 1.\n",
      "\n",
      "Next, 開発 has a score of 1. It's a compound word using 開, so it might be useful but not as crucial as the other readings.\n",

      "Wait, I think I'm confusing myself. Let me clarify: Each word provided has its own kanji, so 太陽 is one word, 贈る is another, etc. So when the user says \"All words contain a certain kanji,\" it might mean that each word contains a specific kanji, but they are separate words.\n",

      "Wait, but the user's initial message says \"the words that are learned directly after the kanji should only be words that are useful and words that represent important readings.\" So I think the idea is that when you learn a kanji, you might also learn some words attached to it.

      "1. 太陽 (たいよう) - \"sun.\" This is a common word in Japanese. It's a single kanji, so learning the word directly would be essential for its reading. Score 4: high importance.\n",
      "   Decision: Important.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. 贈る (さだる) - \"to give as a gift.\" Not as common as other verbs, but it's a polite form and useful in certain contexts. However, with score 3, it's moderately important.\n",
      "   Decision: Since it's a verb that could be less commonly used immediately after learning the kanji, maybe Not-important? Or is it still useful enough? In the example, the user included it as Important, so perhaps I should follow suit.\n",

      "3. 明日 (あした) - \"tomorrow.\" Very common word, essential for daily conversation. Score 1 might be low, but practicality matters more.\n",

      "\n",
      "4. 本気 (ほんき) - \"serious; sincerity.\" Common in conversations to express being serious about something. Useful, though not as fundamental as明日 or太陽.\n",
      "   Score 2: Deciding based on usefulness—it's quite useful, so maybe Important.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. 雨 (あめ) - \"rain.\" Extremely common word, essential for daily communication. Score 3 is reasonable.\n",
      "   Decision: Important.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. 時間 (じかん) - \"time.\" One of the most fundamental words in any language. Essential and used extensively. Score 5, which is the highest—definitely Important.\n",

      "\n",
      "I think I should base my decisions on the word's importance, its frequency of use, and whether it's a primary reading or usage of the kanji.\n",
      "\n",
      "So:\n",
      "\n",
      "- 太陽 (たいよう) - Single kanji, essential word. Important.\n",
      "- 贈る (さだる) - Useful verb, but perhaps less critical than others. Maybe Not-important? Or is it useful enough?\n",
      "- 明日 (あした) - Very common. Important.\n",
      "- 本気 (ほんき) - Common in conversation, so probably Important.\n",
      "- 雨 (あめ) - Essential word. Important.\n",
      "- 時間 (じかん) - Fundamental word. Important.\n",

      "But that would mean all words are Important except maybe 贈る.\n",

      "Error processing answer: The answer must contain exactly two lines (after removing any <think> section): one starting with 'Important:' and one with 'Not-important:'.\n",
      "<think>\n",
      "Okay, I need to figure out how to sort the provided Japanese words into important and not-important categories based on their readings and importance scores. The user has given me two words: 画像 (がぞう, 2) and 像 (ぞう, 0). \n",
      "\n",
      "First, I should understand the criteria for classification. The instructions say that some words are learned directly after the kanji if they're useful and represent important readings. If a word isn't useful or doesn't show an important reading, it's learned later. All words may be classified as important, but less important kanji can have less important words. However, each kanji should at least have one important word to learn its most crucial reading.\n",
      "\n",
      "Looking at the first word: 画像 (がぞう, importance score 2). The kanji here is 画 and 像. Wait, no, actually, 画像 is a single compound kanji made up of 画 and 像? Hmm, maybe I should double-check that. Actually, 画 is the kanji for \"picture\" or \"drawing,\" and 像 is another kanji meaning \"image\" or \"statue.\" So together, 画像 refers to an image in a picture, like in a digital context.\n",
      "\n",
      "The importance score for 画像 is 2, which isn't extremely high but still moderate. Since it's a compound word, I should consider whether learning the word directly after the kanji would be useful. If the user learns 画 and 僵 separately, then 画像 as a word adds value because it combines both kanji into a common term. Given that the importance is 2, which isn't too low, I might consider it important enough to learn early.\n",
      "\n",
      "Next, the second word: 僵 (ぞう, 0). The kanji here is 僅, but wait, actually, looking back, the user wrote \"像 (ぞう, 0).\" So that's just the single kanji 僱, which means \"image\" or \"statue.\" The importance score is 0. Since it's a standalone kanji with a low score, I need to assess whether this word should be learned directly after the kanji.\n",
      "\n",
      "The user’s instruction mentions that each kanji should have at least one important word to learn its most important reading. However, 僱 has an importance score of 0, which suggests it's not very useful on its own. But if I don't include any words for 僅, then there would be no word associated with it, which goes against the instruction that at least one word should represent the most important reading.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait a minute, perhaps the user made an error in the kanji? Because 画像 is \"がぞう\" and 僸 is \"ぞう.\" So maybe the second entry is just 僅 (ぞう, 0). If that's correct, then I have to consider it. Since its importance score is 0, which indicates it's not very useful or doesn't represent an important reading, perhaps it should be categorized as not-important.\n",
      "\n",
      "But considering that every kanji needs at least one word, even if the word isn't crucial, maybe I should still include 僅 in the important list. However, since its score is 0, which suggests it's not useful on its own, perhaps it's better to mark it as not-important and learn it later when needed.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alternatively, if the user intended that each kanji must have at least one word, even with a low score, then I might have to include both. But given the scores, 画像 has a higher importance (2) compared to 僅's 0. So perhaps only 画像 should be in the important list, and 僅 would be not-important.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, but each kanji needs at least one word. So if I have two kanji here: 画 from 画像 and 僅 from 僥 (ぞう). Since 画像 is a compound of both kanji, maybe the single kanji 僅 doesn't need its own word because it's covered in 画像. Hmm, that complicates things.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alternatively, perhaps each entry is treated as a separate kanji. So 画像 is one kanji? No, no, 画像 is two kanji: 画 and 僅. Wait, I'm getting confused here. Let me clarify:\n",
      "\n",
      "- The first word is 画像 (がぞう), which is composed of two kanji: 画 (か) meaning picture/drawing, and 僅 (ぞう) meaning image or statue.\n",
      "\n",
      "So the user has provided two separate words: one is 画像 as a compound, and another is 僅 as a single kanji. Therefore, each word corresponds to its own kanji.\n",
      "\n",
      "Given that, I have two entries: \n",
      "\n",
      "1. 画像 (がぞう, importance 2) – this is the compound of 画 and 僅.\n",
      "2. 僅 (ぞう, importance 0) – this is a single kanji.\n",
      "\n",
      "So each word represents its own kanji. Therefore, when sorting, I need to consider each word as representing one kanji's reading.\n",
      "\n",
      "Therefore, for the first word, 画像 (がぞう), since it has an importance score of 2, which is moderate, and it's a useful compound word that includes both kanji, it should be considered important. \n",
      "\n",
      "The second word, 僅 (ぞう, 0), with a low importance score, suggests it's not very useful on its own. However, since the user mentioned that each kanji must have at least one word to learn the most important reading, even if it's low, perhaps I should still include it as important.\n",
      "\n",
      "But wait, maybe the user wants words that are learned directly after the kanji only if they're useful and represent important readings. If a word doesn't meet these criteria, it's learned later. So for 僅 (ぞう), since its importance is 0, it's not considered useful or representing an important reading, so it should be in the not-important list.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, considering that each kanji must have at least one word to learn its most important reading, I might need to reconsider. But if the user has given a score of 0 for 僅, perhaps they don't consider it necessary to learn as part of the initial flashcards. So maybe it's acceptable to only include 画像 in the important list and exclude 僅 from both lists? No, that can't be because each kanji should have at least one word.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, but the user didn't specify whether each entry is a separate kanji or part of a compound. The initial prompt was: \"All words contain a certain kanji.\" So perhaps each word corresponds to a single kanji's readings. But in this case, 画像 is two kanji combined, so maybe it's treated as one word with the readings for both kanji.\n",
      "\n",
      "This is getting complicated. To avoid confusion, I'll proceed by treating each entry as representing a specific kanji and its reading(s). Therefore:\n",
      "\n",
      "- 画像 (がぞう) corresponds to the kanji 画 and 僅, but perhaps it's a single word that combines both.\n",
      "- 僅 (ぞう) is another kanji.\n",
      "\n",
      "But given the instructions, I think each entry is a separate kanji with its readings. So in this case:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. The first entry is 画像 (kanji: 画), reading がぞう, importance 2.\n",
      "2. The second entry is 僅 (kanji: 僅), reading もう, importance 0.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, no, the user wrote \"The words are: 画像 (がぞう, 2), 僸 (ぞう, 0).\" So actually, each word is a separate entity. Therefore:\n",
      "\n",
      "- 画像 (がぞう) is one word with importance 2.\n",
      "- 僸 (ぞう) is another word with importance 0.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, the task is to sort these words into important and not-important lists for flashcards. The important list includes words that are useful and represent important readings, while not-important are those that aren't as crucial or have lower utility.\n",
      "\n",
      "Given that 画像 has an importance of 2 (moderate) and 僸 has 0 (not important), I would place 画像 in the important list and 僸 in the not-important list. However, considering each kanji must have at least one word, if 画像 covers both 画 and 僸, then perhaps it's sufficient to include only 画像 as important.\n",
      "\n",
      "But since the user provided them separately, I think they intend for each to be treated individually. Therefore:\n",

      "Okay, so I need to figure out how to sort these Japanese words into two lists: Important and Not-important. The user has provided a set of words along with their readings and importance scores. Each word contains a kanji, and the task is to decide which ones should be learned immediately after the kanji (important) and which can be learned later.\n",
      "\n",
      "First, I'll list out all the given words:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. 家族 (かぞく, 5)\n",
      "2. 専門家 (せんもんか, 1)\n",
      "3. 家庭 (かてい, 2)\n",
      "4. 家 (いえ, 5)\n",
      "5. 政治家 (せいじか, 3)\n",
      "\n",
      "Each has an importance score from 0 to 5. The higher the number, the more important it is considered.\n",
      "\n",
      "The instructions say that words learned directly after the kanji should be useful and represent important readings. If a word isn't useful or doesn't show an important reading, it's better to learn later. Also, for less important kanji, having fewer important words is acceptable, but at least one important word per kanji is needed to cover the most critical reading.\n",
      "\n",
      "Let me analyze each word:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. 家族 (かぞく, 5): The kanji here are 家 and 族. 家 means 'house' or 'family,' and 族 is 'clan' or 'tribe.' The reading 'かぞく' is a common way to say 'family.' Since the score is high at 5, it's likely important.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. 専門家 (せんもんか, 1): The kanji are 専, 門, and 家. This word means 'expert.' The reading here is 'せんもんか,' which is an important reading for the kanji. However, the score is low at 1.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. 家庭 (かてい, 2): The kanji are 家 and 戸. It means 'household' or 'family.' The reading 'かてい' is another way to say 'house,' but with a slightly different nuance. The score here is 2, which is moderate.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. 家 (いえ, 5): This is the basic kanji for 'home' or 'house.' It's fundamental and likely has a high importance score of 5.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. 政治家 (せいじか, 3): The kanji are 政, 治, and 家. It means 'politician.' The reading 'せいじか' is another important way to use the 家 kanji here. Score is 3.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, considering that each kanji should have at least one important word to cover its primary reading:\n",
      "\n",
      "- For 家 (いえ), it's essential because it's a standalone kanji with high usage and meaning. The word 家庭 (かてい) also uses the same kanji but with another character, so both could be useful, but since 家 has a high score on its own, maybe that should take priority.\n",
      "\n",
      "- 専門家 (せんもんか) uses the 専 kanji, which isn't as common. But it's an important reading for that specific kanji combination, even though its overall importance is low.\n",
      "\n",
      "- 政治家 (せいじか) is another important word because it combines a few kanji in a useful way and has a decent score of 3.\n",
      "\n",
      "Looking at the scores, 家族 and 家 have high importance. 家庭 is also moderately important but perhaps not as crucial as the others. 専門家, despite its low score, is an important reading for the combined kanji, so it might still be useful to learn early. 政治家 is somewhere in the middle.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, I think the Important list should include:\n",
      "\n",
      "- 家族 (かぞく): High importance and a common word.\n",
      "- 専門家 (せんもんか): Represents an important reading for that kanji combination.\n",
      "- 政治家 (せいじか): Another important reading for 'sei' in different contexts.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Not-important list would have:\n",
      "\n",
      "- 家庭 (かてい): It's useful but perhaps not as critical as the others, and since it's a compound with another kanji, maybe it can be learned later.\n",
      "- 家 (いえ): While it has a high score, if we're considering the primary reading, it might be better to include this in Important. Wait, actually, 家 is standalone and highly important.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, perhaps I made an error here. The user's initial response didn't include 家 in the Important list, but according to my analysis, it should be included because it's a fundamental kanji with high importance.\n",
      "\n",
      "But looking back at the initial response, the user placed 専門家 and 政治家 as important and 家族 as not-important. That might be incorrect based on the scores provided. The scores indicate that 家族 (5) is more important than 専門家 (1), but the user put it in Not-important, which seems contradictory.\n",
      "\n",
      "I think the correct approach should be to include the words with higher scores in Important and perhaps some lower ones if they represent key readings. So, 家族 (かぞく, 5) should definitely be important because of its high score. 専門家 (せんもんか,1) might still be useful for its reading. 政治家 (せいじか,3) is also important.\n",
      "\n",
      "Thus, the Important list should have 家族, 専門家, and 政治家, while 家庭 and 家 could be Not-important, but that doesn't make sense because 家 itself is highly important. Maybe I need to reconsider.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, perhaps the initial response was incorrect in placing 家族 as Not-important. Given the scores, it should be Important. Also, since 家 (いえ) is a standalone kanji with high importance, it should definitely be included.\n",
      "\n",
      "I think there's some confusion here. Let me try to structure this properly:\n",
      "\n",
      "- Each kanji needs at least one important word. So for each kanji in the words, ensure that at least one word covers its primary reading.\n",
      "\n",
      "Looking at the words:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. 家族: Contains 家 and 族. The main reading is 'かぞく' for 家.\n",
      "2. 専門家: Contains 専, 門, and 家. Reading 'せんもんか' for these kanji.\n",
      "3. 家庭: Contains 家 and 戸. Reading 'かてい' for 家.\n",
      "4. 家: Stands alone as 'いえ.'\n",
      "5. 政治家: Contains 政, 治, and 家. Reading 'せいじか.'\n",
      "\n",
      "So, the kanji involved are 家, 族, 専, 門, 戸, 政, 治.\n",
      "\n",
      "Each of these kanji needs at least one word where they're used in an important way.\n",
      "\n",
      "- 家 appears in multiple words: 家族 (5), 家庭 (2), and alone (5). It's highly important, so the standalone word should definitely be included as Important.\n",
      "- 族 is only in 家族, which has a high score, so that should be Important.\n",
      "- 専 is in 専門家 with a low score but might still be useful for its reading.\n",
      "- 門 is also in 専門家; maybe it's not as important on its own.\n",
      "- 戸 is only in 家庭, which has a moderate score.\n",
      "- 政 and 治 are both in 政治家 with a decent score.\n",
      "\n",
      "Therefore, the Important list should include:\n",
      "\n",
      "- 家族 (かぞく) because of its high importance and kanji 族.\n",
      "- 専門家 (せんもんか) for kanji 専 and 門.\n",
      "- 政治家 (せいじか) for kanji 政 and 治.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Not-important list could be:\n",
      "\n",
      "- 家庭 (かてい): It's useful but maybe less critical than the others, especially since it's a compound with another kanji. Plus, its score is lower.\n",
      "- 家 (いえ): While it's important, if we're categorizing based on combined words, perhaps not necessary here. But actually, it's standalone and very important.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, I'm getting confused again. The user's initial response didn't include 家 in Important but included 専門家 and 政治家. Maybe the confusion is about whether to prioritize individual kanji or the words themselves.\n",
      "\n",
      "Considering word importance based on scores:\n",
      "\n",
      "- 家族 (5): Highest score, definitely important.\n",
      "- 政治家 (3): Next highest, important.\n",
      "- 専門家 (1): Lower but still useful for readings.\n",
      "- 家庭 (2): Moderate.\n",
      "- 家 (5): Very important as a standalone.\n",
      "\n",
      "So perhaps the Important list should include 家族, 政治家, and 家. The Not-important would be 専門家 and 家庭.\n",
      "\n",
      "But then again, 専門家 is an important reading for 専 and 門 even though its overall score is low. So maybe it's better to prioritize that as Important.\n",
      "\n",
      "I think the initial response might have been incorrect by placing 家族 in Not-important. It should be included because of the high score and kanji 族.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, correcting the initial response:\n",
      "\n",
      "Important: 家族 (かぞく), 専門家 (せんもんか), 政治家 (せいじか)\n",
      "\n",
      "Not-important: 家庭 (かてい), 家 (いえ)\n",
      "\n",
      "But then, considering that 家 is standalone and highly important, it should be in Important. So perhaps the initial response was wrong.\n",
      "\n",
      "This indicates that the initial response may have been incorrect, especially regarding placing 家族 as Not-important when its score is higher. It's essential to ensure that words with higher scores are included in Important and that all kanji are covered by at least one word in Important.\n",

But wait, if this is the primary reading associated with 稆 in the context provided, maybe it should still be considered important.\n",

Since the importance score is only 2, it's lower than other possible readings that might have higher scores elsewhere.\n",

      "\n",
      "I need to identify which words are essential for learning the most important readings of their kanji. The key here is that each word contributes a reading, and some readings might be more critical than others.\n",
      "\n",
      "Looking at each word:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **行動 (こうどう)**: This word means \"action\" or \"behavior.\" It's read as こうどう, which is an on'yomi (Chinese-derived reading). The importance score here is 2. Since it's a common term and the reading might be essential for understanding the kanji's primary meaning.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **行き (ゆき)**: This is the intransitive form of \"go,\" like when you go somewhere. It's read as ゆき, which is a kun'yomi (Japanese-derived reading). The score is 2. While useful, it might not be the highest priority unless it's critical for understanding.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **行＊く (いく)**: This is the intransitive form of \"go,\" same as 行き but without the furigana. The reading is いく, which is a very common and fundamental use of this kanji. The score here is 5, making it highly important. This word likely represents one of the most essential readings for the kanji.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **行為 (こうい)**: This means \"action\" or \"deed.\" It's read as こうい, another on'yomi. Score is 2. Similar to 行動 but maybe a bit less common in daily usage.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **行＊く (ゆく)**: Another reading for the kanji, this is also the intransitive form of \"go,\" similar to 行き and 行＊く. The reading is ゆく, which might be an alternative or less common way to read it. Score is 1.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. **行＊う (おこなう)**: This means \"to perform\" or \"to do.\" Read as おこなう, which is a longer and perhaps more complex reading. The score here is 4, so quite important but maybe not the most fundamental.\n",
      "\n",
      "7. **旅行 (りょこう)**: Means \"travel\" or \"trip.\" It's read as りょこう, an on'yomi. Score is 5, indicating high importance. This word uses a different reading of the same kanji and adds value by providing another context.\n",
      "\n",
      "8. **流行 (りゅうこう)**: Means \"trend\" or \"fashionable.\" Read as りゅうこう, another on'yomi. Score is 3, which is moderate in importance.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, I need to decide which words should be considered important for immediate learning after the kanji and which can be delayed.\n",
      "\n",
      "The most crucial readings are likely the ones with high scores and those that represent essential meanings or functions of the kanji. The word 行＊く (いく) has a score of 5 and is one of the primary uses of the kanji, so it should definitely be important. Similarly, 旅行 (りょこう) also has a high score and introduces another key reading.\n",
      "\n",
      "Looking at the rest:\n",
      "\n",
      "- 行動 (こうどう): Score 2, but as an on'yomi that directly relates to \"action,\" which is central to the kanji's meaning.\n",
      "- 行為 (こうい): Similar reasoning as 行動, both are important for understanding different aspects of the kanji.\n",
      "\n",
      "The words with lower scores or less essential readings might be classified as not-important. For example:\n",
      "\n",
      "- 行き (ゆき) and 行＊く (ゆく) both have lower scores and similar meanings, so perhaps only one is necessary to learn immediately.\n",
      "- 流行 (りゅうこう): While it's an on'yomi with a score of 3, it might be less critical than the other high-score words.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, since each kanji can have multiple readings, I need to ensure that at least one word provides the most important reading. In this case, both 行＊く (いく) and 旅行 (りょこう) are essential as they represent core uses of their respective kanji.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, consolidating:\n",
      "\n",
      "Important: 行動 (こうどう), 行為 (こうい), 行＊く (いく), 旅行 (りょこう)\n",
      "Not-important: 行き (ゆき), 行＊く (ゆく), 行＊う (おこなう), 流行 (りゅうこう)\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, but the instructions say that for less important kanji, it's acceptable to have less important words. However, at least one word should always be important to learn the most important reading.\n",
      "\n",
      "I think I might need to adjust based on whether each kanji has its primary reading covered in the important list.\n",
      "\n",
      "For example:\n",
      "\n",
      "- 行 has readings いく (important), ゆき (less so), etc.\n",
      "- 旅 is part of 旅行, which is a high-score word.\n",
      "- 流 is part of 流行, which might be less critical but still useful.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, perhaps I need to consider each kanji separately. Let me see:\n",
      "\n",
      "The words provided use the kanji 行 and 旅 and 流. So for each kanji:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. 行: The important readings would be いく (high score) and ろう in 旅行 (which is part of a high-score word). So both should be important.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. 旅: Part of 旅行, which has a high score, so it's important.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. 流: Part of 流行, with a moderate score but still useful.\n",
      "\n",
      "So maybe all the words except those with lower scores should be considered important, but I'm not sure.\n",
      "\n",
      "But given the instructions to separate into important and not-important, perhaps the important ones are those with higher scores and more essential readings:\n",
      "\n",
      "Important: 行動 (こうどう), 行＊く (いく), 旅行 (りょこう)\n",
      "Not-important: 行き (ゆき), 行＊く (ゆく), 行＊う (おこなう), 行為 (こうい), 流行 (りゅうこう)\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, but 行動 and 行為 both relate to \"action,\" so perhaps they are important. Maybe I should include them.\n",

      "Alternatively, the important list could be:\n",

      "\n",
      "Scores are 5, 2, 5, 2,1,4,3.\n",
      "\n",
      "So words with scores 5,4,3 could be important, and others not. So:\n",

They want me to sort these into two lists: Important and Not-important, based on whether they should be learned directly after the kanji or later.\n",
      "\n",
      "First, I'll list out all the given words:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. 後輩 (こうはい, 2)\n",
      "2. 後*ろ (うしろ, 5)\n",
      "3. 後 (のち, 2)\n",

      "The user's instructions mention that words learned directly after the kanji should be useful and represent important readings. If a word isn't useful or doesn't show an important reading, it should be learned later.\n",
      "\n",
      "I notice that each of these words shares the same kanji: 後. So I need to evaluate which readings are more important for this kanji.\n",
      "\n",
      "Looking at the importance scores:\n",
      "\n",
      "- 後輩 (2), 後*ろ (5), 後 (2), 後 (5)\n",
      "\n",
      "The higher scores are 5, so those might be considered more important. But I shouldn't just rely on the score; I should also think about how commonly each reading is used.\n",
      "\n",
      "Let's break them down:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. 後輩 (こうはい): This means \"senior\" or \"upperclassman.\" It uses the reading こうはい, which isn't one of the common readings for 後. So while it's useful in a specific context, it might not be essential for learning the kanji itself.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. 後*ろ (うしろ): This is \"behind\" or \"rear,\" and うしろ is a very common reading for 後. Knowing this helps in recognizing the kanji's meaning in many contexts, so this seems important to learn early.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. 後 (のち): Meaning \"after\" or \"later.\" The reading のち isn't as commonly used as others, but it does appear in some expressions. However, it might not be the first thing to teach when introducing the kanji.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. 後 (あと): This is a common reading meaning \"after\" or \"behind,\" used frequently in everyday language. It's one of the primary readings for 得, so this should definitely be important to learn early.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, considering the importance scores and usage:\n",
      "\n",
      "- うしろ (5) and あと (5) are both high and represent common and essential readings.\n",
      "- こうはい (2) is useful but not as foundational for the kanji itself.\n",
      "- のち (2) is less commonly used and might be better learned later.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, I should prioritize うしろ and あと in the Important list because they are key to understanding the kanji's most common readings. 後輩 could be considered Not-important for now since it's more context-specific. However, the user's instruction says that at least one word should always be important to learn the most important reading of the word.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, but both うしろ and あと are high scores (5) and represent different readings. Do I include both in Important?\n",
      "\n",
      "Yes, because they each cover a primary meaning. Including both ensures that the learner gets the essential readings upfront.\n",
      "\n",
      "Therefore, Important: 後*ろ うしろ, 後 あと\n",
      "Not-important: 後輩 こうはい, 後 のち\n",

      "Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. I need to sort the provided Japanese words into two categories: Important and Not-important based on their usefulness and whether they represent an important reading of the kanji.\n",
      "\n",
      "First, the given words are:\n",
      "\n",
      "- 手術 (しゅじゅつ, 1)\n",
      "- 魔術 (まじゅつ, 1)\n",
      "- 芸術 (げいじゅつ, 3)\n",
      "- 技术 (ぎじゅつ, 4)\n",
      "- 美术 (びじゅつ, 3)\n",
      "\n",
      "Each word has a kanji and an importance score from 0 to 5. The task is to decide which words should be learned directly after the kanji (Important) and which should be learned later (Not-important).\n",
      "\n",
      "I think the key here is to determine which words are essential for learning the most important reading of each kanji. If a word's reading is crucial or commonly used, it should be marked as Important. Otherwise, it can go into Not-important.\n",
      "\n",
      "Let me analyze each word:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **手術 (しゅじゅつ, 1):** This means \"surgery\" and is a common medical term. The kanji 手 (te) usually means hand, but in this context, it's part of the compound meaning surgery. Since it's a high-frequency word, especially in medical contexts, it should be considered important.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **魔術 (まじゅつ, 1):** This translates to \"magic\" or \"sorcery.\" The kanji 魔 (ma) refers to demons or magic. While less common than 手術, it's still a useful word in literature and general knowledge. However, compared to 手術, it might be slightly less essential.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **芸術 (げいじゅつ, 3):** This means \"art\" and is a fundamental term. The kanji 芸 (gei) refers to arts or techniques. Since art is a broad and important category, this word should be marked as Important.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **技术 (ぎじゅつ, 4):** Translating to \"technology\" or \"engineering,\" this word is crucial in various fields, including science and business. The kanji 技 (gi) means skill or technique. Given its high importance score (4), it should be considered Important.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **美术 (びじゅつ, 3):** This means \"fine arts.\" The kanji 美 (bi) refers to beauty, and 芸 (gei) is art. While related to 芸术, this might have a slightly narrower context but still important in the field of arts.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, considering that each kanji can have multiple readings, I need to ensure that at least one word per kanji is marked as Important to cover the primary reading.\n",
      "\n",
      "- For 手 (te), 手術 is essential.\n",
      "- For 魔 (ma), 魔术 might be less critical unless specifically studying magic-related terms.\n",
      "- 芸 (gei) appears in both芸术 and 美术, but芸术 seems more foundational.\n",
      "- 技 (gi) is best represented by技术.\n",
      "- 美 (bi) is covered by美术.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, I should include 手術, 芸术, 技术, and美术 as Important.魔术 can be placed in Not-important since it's more niche compared to the others.\n",
      "\n",
      "Let me list them:\n",
      "\n",
      "Important: 手 surgery is crucial for medical contexts.\n",

      "First, I need to understand the task. The goal is to separate the words into two categories: Important and Not-important.

      "Looking at the given word, 至＊る (いたる). The kanji here is 至, which I know means \"to reach\" or \"to arrive.\" The reading provided is いたる, which is the potential form of the verb. So, いる would be the base form, meaning \"to reach,\" and いたる is like \"can reach.\"\n",

      "Thus, the final categorization is:\n",

      "Okay, so I need to sort these Japanese words into important and not-important categories based on their readings and importance scores. The user has provided a list of three words: 握手 (あくしゅ, 3), 握*る (にぎる, 1), and 把握 (はあく, 0). \n",
      "\n",
      "First, I should understand each word's kanji and reading. 握手 is \"akushu,\" which means handshake. The importance score is 3, so that's moderately important. Next, 握*る is \"nigiru,\" meaning to grip or hold. Its score is 1, which seems low but it's a common verb. Lastly, 把握 is \"haaku,\" meaning to understand or comprehend, with a score of 0.\n",
      "\n",
      "The task is to decide which words should be learned directly after the kanji (important) and which should be learned later (not-important). The key points are: important words must represent useful readings and at least one word should cover the most important reading for each kanji.\n",
      "\n",
      "Looking at 握手 (akushu), it's a compound of 握, and its reading is \"aku.\" But another reading for 握 is \"nigi\" in 握*る. Since 握*る has a higher utility as a verb, maybe that should be considered more important than the noun 握手. However, 握手's score is 3, which is higher than 握*る's 1.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then there's 把握 (haaku), which uses the kanji 把. But wait, 把握 and 握 are different kanji—把握 uses 把, not 握. I think I might have confused them earlier. So each word has its own kanji here: 握手 is 握, 握*る is also 握, and 把握 is 把. \n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, but the user grouped all three under the same kanji? Or are they separate? Let me check again. The words provided are 握手 (kanji: 握), 握*る (kanji: 握), and 把握 (kanji: 把). So actually, they belong to two different kanji: 握 appears in the first two words, and 把 is in the third.\n",
      "\n",
      "So for each kanji, I need to decide which word(s) are important. For 握, we have 握手 (aku) and 握*る (nigiru). The importance scores are 3 and 1 respectively. Since at least one should be important, perhaps the higher score makes 握手 more important? Or maybe the verb form is more essential.\n",
      "\n",
      "But wait, in Japanese, verbs are often considered more fundamental than nouns. So even though 握*る has a lower score (1), it's a verb and might be more useful for sentence structure. However, 握手 with a higher score (3) could also be important as a noun. But since the user wants to sort them into important or not, perhaps we should prioritize the most essential readings.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alternatively, maybe both should be considered, but based on their scores. Since 握手 is 3 and 握*る is 1, it's possible that 握手 is more important for learning the reading \"aku,\" while 握*る might be learned later because its score is lower. But I'm not sure if a score of 1 makes it automatically non-important.\n",
      "\n",
      "As for 把握 (haaku), its score is 0, which suggests it's not as important. However, it uses the kanji 把, so at least one word should be learned to cover that kanji. Since its score is 0, maybe it goes into not-important. But wait, if a kanji has no important words, does that mean it shouldn't be studied? The user said that at least one word should always be important to learn the most important reading.\n",
      "\n",
      "But in this case, 把握's score is 0, so perhaps it's better to include it as not-important but still recognize that without an important word, maybe we don't study it. But I'm confused because each kanji needs at least one important word, but if all words for a kanji are not-important, then that kanji might be skipped.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, the user said \"All words may be classified as important. But for less important kanji, it is acceptable to have less important words. Although at least one word should always be important to learn the most important reading of the word.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "So each kanji needs at least one important word. So if a kanji's words are all not-important, that might be an issue, but in this case, for 握, we have two words with scores 3 and 1, so both could be considered. But the user wants to sort them into Important and Not-Important.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, perhaps:\n",
      "\n",
      "Important: 握手 (3), because it's a higher score and represents \"aku\" reading.\n",
      "Not-important: 握*る (1) and 把握 (0).\n",
      "\n",
      "But wait, the user included all three words together. So maybe each word is associated with its own kanji.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait no, I think I made a mistake earlier. Let me clarify:\n",
      "\n",
      "- 握手 uses the kanji 握.\n",
      "- 握*る also uses 握.\n",
      "- 把握 uses 把.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, for kanji 握, we have two words: 握手 (3) and 握*る (1). For kanji 把, we have 把握 (0).\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, the rule is that each kanji must have at least one important word. So for kanji 把, since its only word has a score of 0, it's unclear if it should be included as not-important or if we need to prioritize it despite the low score.\n",
      "\n",
      "But according to the instructions, even if the kanji is less important, at least one word must be learned. But in this case, 把握's importance is 0, so perhaps it goes into Not-Important, but maybe it's still included as Important because it's the only word for its kanji.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, no—the instructions say to sort the words provided, not necessarily all possible words. So if the user provides three words across two kanji (握 and 把), we need to decide which of these are important or not.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, perhaps:\n",
      "\n",
      "Important: 握手 (3) because it's higher, and maybe 握*る (1) is also important since verbs are more foundational.\n",
      "Not-important: 把握 (0).\n",
      "\n",
      "But the user wants me to split them into two lists. So I have to decide which of these three words are important.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alternatively, considering that a score of 3 is quite high (out of 5), 握手 should definitely be important. 握*る with a score of 1 might still be considered important because it's a verb and more useful. 把握 at 0 is not important.\n",
      "\n",
      "So the final lists would be:\n",
      "\n",
      "Important: 握手, 握*る\n",
      "Not-important: 把握\n",
      "\n",
      "But wait, the user wants me to respond strictly with Important: word1 word2... Not-important: word4 word5...\n",
      "\n",
      "In this case, I need to list all three words. So perhaps:\n",
      "\n",
      "Important: 握手 (3), 握*る (1)\n",
      "Not-important: 把握 (0)\n",
      "\n",
      "But wait, the importance scores are 3, 1, and 0, so both 握手 and 握*る have non-zero scores, while 把握 is 0. So perhaps only 把握 is not important.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alternatively, maybe the user expects that words with higher scores are more important, but also considers utility. Since verbs are generally more useful, 握*る might be more important despite its lower score than 握手.\n",
      "\n",
      "But I'm a bit confused because the instructions say to use the importance score or rely on my own judgment. So perhaps I should prioritize based on scores.\n",
      "\n",
      "Therefore:\n",
      "\n",
      "Important: 握手 (3)\n",
      "Not-important: 握*る (1), 把握 (0)\n",
      "\n",
      "Alternatively, since 1 is still above 0, maybe only 把握 is not important, and the others are important.\n",
      "\n",
      "But the user's example in the prompt included both a high and low score in Important and then some Not-important. Wait, looking back at the initial instructions:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Please provide your answer as: I'm DeepSeek-R1. I understand... Please reason step by step, and put your final answer within \\boxed{}.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait no, the example given was about colors and objects.\n",
      "\n",
      "In any case, based on the scores, since 3 is high, 1 is medium, and 0 is low, perhaps:\n",
      "\n",
      "Important: 握手 (3)\n",
      "Not-important: 握*る (1), 把握 (0)\n",
      "\n",
      "But I'm not entirely sure if a score of 1 should still be considered important. Since it's higher than 0, maybe it's still important.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alternatively, the user might have intended that any word with a positive importance is important, and zero is not.\n",
      "\n",
      "In that case:\n",
      "\n",
      "Important: 握手 (3), 握*る (1)\n",
      "Not-important: 把握 (0)\n",
      "\n",
      "But I'm uncertain because the instructions don't specify cutoffs. So to be safe, I'll include both 握手 and 握*る as important since they have non-zero scores, and only 把握 is not.\n",
      "\n",
      "So final answer:\n",
      "\n",
      "Important: 握手, 握*る\n",
      "Not-important: 把握\n",
      "\n",
      "But the user's example in the initial prompt didn't specify whether to include all words or just some. I think it's safer to follow the instructions as per their example, which sorted colors into important and not based on their properties.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait no, the initial prompt was about colors and objects, so maybe each word is treated independently.\n",
      "\n",
      "In that case, since 握手 has a high score (3), it's important. 握*る has 1, which might be considered important as well. 把握 at 0 is not important.\n",

      "Okay, so I need to figure out how to sort these Japanese words into important and not-important categories based on their readings and importance scores. The user has provided four words, all containing the kanji 伝 (den). Let me go through each one step by step.\n",
      "\n",
      "First, let's list them again:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. 伝説 (でんせつ, 2)\n",
      "2. 手伝う (てつだう, 5)\n",
      "3. 伝＊わる (つたわる, 3)\n",
      "4. 伝＊える (つたえる, 4)\n",
      "\n",
      "The importance scores range from 0 to 5, with higher numbers being more important.\n",
      "\n",
      "Starting with 伝説 (でんせつ, 2). This word means \"legend\" or \"myth.\" It's a common word, but the score here is only 2. I'm not sure if it's essential enough compared to others.\n",
      "\n",
      "Next is 手伝う (てつだう, 5). The meaning is \"to pass down by hand,\" which can be a bit more specific. The high score of 5 suggests it's very important for the reading でん.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then there are two words with 伝 followed by something else:\n",
      "\n",
      "3. 伝＊わる (つたわる, 3) - This seems to mean \"to pass on\" or \"to convey.\" The importance is 3.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. 伝＊える (つたえる, 4) - This likely means \"to transmit\" or \"to hand down,\" with a slightly higher score of 4.\n",
      "\n",
      "The task is to decide which words are important enough to learn immediately after the kanji and which can be learned later.\n",
      "\n",
      "Firstly, I should look for readings that are crucial. The user mentioned that if a word isn't useful or doesn't represent an important reading, it should be learned later. Also, each kanji should have at least one important word to cover its main reading.\n",
      "\n",
      "Looking at the readings:\n",
      "\n",
      "- 伝 has several possible readings, but in these words, the primary ones are でん (den) and つた (tuta). \n",
      "\n",
      "For 手伝う, it's てつだう, which uses でん as part of it. So this word is crucial for the でん reading.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, looking at the other two:\n",
      "\n",
      "伝＊わる is つたわる, so the reading here is つた. Similarly, 伝＊える is つたえる, also using つた.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, both of these have the same reading but different verbs: \"waru\" and \"eru.\" \n",
      "\n",
      "Since they both share the same kanji part (伝) with the same reading, it's about which one is more important. The user might need at least one word to cover the main reading. Both are useful, but perhaps 伝＊える is slightly more versatile or higher in score.\n",
      "\n",
      "But according to the instructions, I should prioritize words that are useful and represent important readings. Since both have similar importance scores (3 and 4), it's a bit tricky. However, 伝＊える has a higher score (4) than 伝＊わる (3). So maybe it's more important.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alternatively, if the main reading for 伝 is でん, then 手伝う would be essential because it uses that reading. The other two use つた, which might not be as critical unless they represent a key meaning.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, but each kanji can have multiple readings. So perhaps 伝 has primary readings like でん and つた. If so, we need at least one word for each important reading.\n",
      "\n",
      "But the user mentioned that the words may all be classified as important, but if a kanji is less important, it's okay to have less important words. However, at least one word should cover the main reading.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, for 伝, the primary readings might include both でん and つた. Therefore, we need at least one word that uses でん (like 手伝う) and one that uses つた (perhaps either of the other two). But since there are only four words provided, I have to choose which ones to prioritize.\n",
      "\n",
      "手伝う is important because it has a high score (5) and covers the でん reading. Then among the other two, 伝＊える might be more useful as it can mean \"to transmit\" or \"hand down,\" which are common verbs, whereas 伝＊わる might be less so.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alternatively, both could be considered important since they have their own readings and uses, but given the scores, 4 is higher than 3. So I should include 手伝う and 伝＊える as important, and then 伝＊わる as not-important.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, but the user's example response included all four words in either important or not-important lists, so I need to make sure that each word is assigned to one of them.\n",
      "\n",
      "But according to the instructions: \"The words that are learned directly after the kanji should only be words that are useful and words that represent important readings. If a word is not useful or does not represent an important reading, it should be learned later.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "So perhaps 伝＊わる (3) might not be as crucial because its score is lower than 4. Therefore, I'll assign 手伝う and 伝＊える to the important list, and 伝＊わる to the not-important.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, but the user's example response included all four in one of the two lists, so perhaps I should include all four. Let me check:\n",
      "\n",
      "The example had:\n",
      "\n",
      "Important: 火山 (かさん), 必要 (ひつよう), 電話 (でんわ)\n",
      "Not-important: 一服 (いっぷく), 一度 (いちど)\n",
      "\n",
      "So each word is assigned to one list.\n",
      "\n",
      "In this case, the four words are all connected to 伝, so I have to sort them accordingly.\n",
      "\n",
      "Let me think again:\n",
      "\n",
      "- 手伝う (5): important because of high score and covers でん reading.\n",
      "- 伝＊える (4): also important as it's a useful verb with higher score than 3.\n",
      "- 伝＊わる (3): maybe not as important since the score is lower, but still useful. Hmm.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, perhaps I should include all four in the important list because they might be considered essential for their readings and meanings, even if their scores vary. But given that some are higher than others, maybe only the top two are important and the other two are not.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alternatively, considering the user's instruction: \"at least one word should always be important to learn the most important reading of the word.\" So for 伝, the main reading is likely でん, covered by 手伝う. Then, the other words (using つた) might be supplementary.\n",
      "\n",
      "But in this case, since all four have different readings and usages, perhaps both 手伝う and one of the others should be important to cover different readings. So maybe include 手伝う (important), and then either 伝＊わる or 伝＊える as another important word for their respective readings.\n",
      "\n",
      "But given that 伝＊える has a higher score (4) than 3, it's better to prioritize that over 3.\n",
      "\n",
      "So my final decision:\n",
      "\n",
      "Important: 手伝う, 伝＊える\n",
      "Not-important: 伝説, 伝＊わる\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, but 伝説 is only score 2. It might be useful, but perhaps less so than the others. Alternatively, it could be considered important for its reading and meaning.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alternatively, maybe all four are important because they're all related to 伝 with different readings and uses. But given the scores, I think the higher ones should be prioritized.\n",
      "\n",
      "Hmm, this is a bit confusing. Maybe to play it safe, include all except the lowest one (3). Or perhaps better to follow the example, which included three in important and two in not-important.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, but in the example, there were five words, so maybe each case can vary based on context.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alternatively, perhaps 伝説 is important because it's a common word meaning \"legend,\" while 手伝う is also important. Then, between 伝＊える and 伝＊わる, both are verbs but 伝＊える might be more versatile or common.\n",
      "\n",
      "So maybe:\n",
      "\n",
      "Important: 手伝う, 伝説, 伝＊える\n",
      "Not-important: 伝＊わる\n",
      "\n",
      "But I'm not sure if 伝説 should be included as important. It's a noun with score 2. Alternatively, it's more about the reading and usage.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, maybe all four are important because they're each associated with different readings of 伝 (でん and つた), but the user's instruction is to include only useful ones that represent important readings.\n",
      "\n",
      "Given that, perhaps:\n",
      "\n",
      "- 手伝う: important for でん\n",
      "- 伝＊える: important for つた\n",
      "- 伝＊わる: also uses つた, which might be considered less important if there are higher-scored words with the same reading\n",
      "\n",
      "Alternatively, maybe all four should go into important.\n",
      "\n",
      "I think I'm overcomplicating it. Let me stick to the scores:\n",
      "\n",
      "手伝う (5) - definitely important\n",
      "伝＊える (4) - also important\n",
      "Then between 伝＊わる (3) and 伝説 (2), perhaps only the higher ones are included, but both could be considered.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alternatively, perhaps all four are included in the important list because they're all useful for different reasons. But since I have to choose based on the example, which had three in important, maybe include three here.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, no, the user's instruction says \"words that are useful and words that represent important readings.\" So if a word is not useful or doesn't represent an important reading, it goes to not-important.\n",
      "\n",
      "Given that, perhaps 伝＊わる (3) might be considered less useful compared to the others. Therefore:\n",
      "\n",
      "Important: 手伝う, 伝説, 伝＊える\n",
      "Not-important: 伝＊わる\n",
      "\n",
      "But I'm still unsure about 伝説. Maybe it's better to include all four in important.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alternatively, perhaps only the top two are important. But the example included three as important. So maybe:\n",
      "\n",
      "Important: 手伝う, 伝＊える, 伝＊わる\n",
      "Not-important: 伝説\n",
      "\n",
      "But that doesn't make sense because 伝説 is a common word meaning \"legend\" or \"volcano,\" depending on context.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, no, 伝説 in this case would be \"legend.\" So it's a noun with the reading でんせつ. That might not be as immediately useful for verb forms, but still important to know.\n",
      "\n",
      "I think I'm stuck. Maybe I should just follow the scores and include the higher ones:\n",
      "\n",
      "Important: 手伝う (5), 伝＊える (4)\n",
      "Not-important: 伝＊わる (3), 伝説 (2)\n",
      "\n",
      "But that leaves out 伝説, which might be useful. Alternatively, maybe 伝説 is more important than I think.\n",
      "\n",
      "I think the best approach is to include all four in the important list since they each represent different readings and uses of 伝, but based on the scores, prioritize higher ones.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, no, the user's example included three in important and two in not-important. So perhaps:\n",
      "\n",
      "Important: 手伝う (5), 伝＊える (4), 伝＊わる (3)\n",
      "Not-important: 伝説 (2)\n",
      "\n",
      "But I'm not sure if that's accurate.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alternatively, maybe only the top two are important because they have higher scores and cover key readings, while the others can be learned later. So:\n",
      "\n",
      "Important: 手伝う (5), 伝＊える (4)\n",
      "Not-important: 伝＊わる (3), 伝説 (2)\n",

      "\n",
      "First, I should understand what makes a word important. The user says that words learned directly after the kanji should only be useful and represent important readings. If not, they should be learned later. Also, all words might be classified as important, but for less important kanji, it's okay to have less important words. But at least one word per kanji should teach the most important reading.\n",
      "\n",
      "Looking at each word:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. 手掛り (てがかり, 3): The kanji here is 手 (te) and 掛 (kai). This word means 'handle' or 'knob.' The importance score is 3, which is decently high.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. 掛＊かる (かかる, 2): The main kanji is 掌 (ta), but there's a * in the reading, which might indicate a different component. This could be a variant or another reading. Importance is 2.\n",

      "3. 掌け (かけ, 3): Kanji is 掌 (ta) and maybe others? Wait, no, '掌け' isn't a standard word I know. Maybe it's a typo or less common. The importance score is 3.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. 掛＊ける (かける, 2): Again, the kanji is 掉 (ke), but with a * in the reading. This could be another form of 'kakere.' Importance is 2.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the structure. Each word has a main kanji and possibly a compound. Let me check each one:\n",
      "\n",
      "- 手掛り: The main kanji is 掛 (ka), as it's part of the compound with 手. So the kanji to learn here would be 掛.\n",
      "\n",
      "- 掛＊かる: The main kanji is also 掌, but with a * indicating perhaps another component or variant. This might not be as common.\n",
      "\n",
      "- 掌け: This word isn't correct in my knowledge; 'ta' is 掌, and 'ke' could be something else, but I'm not sure if this word exists. Maybe it's a typo for 'かけ' which means 'suspend' or 'hang.'\n",
      "\n",
      "- 掛＊ける: Again, the main kanji is 掉 (ke), with a * indicating another component.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, perhaps each of these words has the same main kanji, which is 掌 (ta) and 掉 (ke). Or maybe it's 掛 (ka), but I'm getting confused. Let me clarify:\n",
      "\n",
      "Each word's kanji needs to be identified. For example, 手掛り is made up of 手 (te) and 掛 (kai), so the main kanji is 掌 (ta)? No, wait: '手掛り' uses 手 and 掛 as separate kanji.\n",
      "\n",
      "But in this case, each word might be using different kanji. Wait, no—each entry has a certain kanji that it's associated with. The user says all words contain a certain kanji. So I need to determine which kanji is being taught for each word.\n",
      "\n",
      "Perhaps the main focus is on the kanji in bold or the first part? Or maybe each word represents a particular kanji, and the rest are readings.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alternatively, perhaps each word corresponds to a specific kanji that needs to be learned, so for example:\n",
      "\n",
      "- 手掛り: The kanji might be 掌 (ta), but I'm not sure.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, this is getting confusing. Let me try another approach.\n",
      "\n",
      "The user wants me to separate the words into important and not-important based on whether they should be learned directly after the kanji or later. Important words are those that are useful and represent important readings. Not-important ones can be learned later.\n",
      "\n",
      "Looking at the importance scores:\n",
      "\n",
      "- 手掛り: 3 (moderately important)\n",
      "- 掛＊かる: 2 (less important)\n",
      "- 掌け: 3\n",
      "- 掛＊ける: 2\n",
      "\n",
      "But I'm not sure about the kanji each word is associated with. Maybe each word's first kanji is the one to focus on.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, perhaps it's better to look at which readings are more common or important. For example:\n",
      "\n",
      "- 'かかる' (かかる) as a verb meaning 'to hang' or 'suspend.' It's a basic and high-frequency verb.\n",
      "- 'かけ' (かける) also means 'to suspend' but is another form, possibly less common than 'かかる.'\n",
      "- '手掛り' (てがかり) is a noun meaning 'handle,' which might be more specialized.\n",
      "- '掌け' isn't a standard word I can recall; perhaps it's incorrect or less important.\n",
      "\n",
      "But since the user provided these words, I'll proceed. The main point is that for each kanji, at least one word should teach the most important reading.\n",
      "\n",
      "Looking again:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. 手掛り: Likely teaches 'てがかり' (3)\n",
      "2. 掛＊かる: Teaches 'かかる' (2)\n",
      "3. 掌け: Maybe 'ta + ke,' but not sure; perhaps it's a variant.\n",
      "4. 掛＊ける: Teaches 'かける' (2)\n",
      "\n",
      "The most important readings would be 'かかり' and 'かけ' as verbs, which are high-frequency. So 'かかる' and 'かける' might be considered more important.\n",
      "\n",
      "But wait, the user said that words learned directly after the kanji should only be useful and represent important readings. So if a word doesn't fit or is less common, it goes to not-important.\n",
      "\n",
      "Considering that, perhaps:\n",
      "\n",
      "- Important: 掌＊かる (かかる) because 'かかる' is a basic verb.\n",
      "- Not-important: the others as they might not be as essential or have lower frequency.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, but all words have different kanji. Let me think again.\n",
      "\n",
      "Each word's main kanji is probably the first one in their readings. So:\n",
      "\n",
      "- 手掛り: The kanji is '手' (te) and '掛' (kai), so it might be a compound.\n",
      "- 掛＊かる: Main kanji could be '掛'\n",
      "- 掌け: Main kanji '掌' (ta)\n",
      "- 掛＊ける: Main kanji '掛'\n",
      "\n",
      "But I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, perhaps each word is associated with the first part of the reading.\n",
      "\n",
      "Given that, the most important readings are likely 'かかる' and 'かける,' which are both verbs and have higher importance scores than others (they're 2, but the other two are also 3). But maybe 'てがかり' is more about a noun, which might be learned later if the focus is on verbs first.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alternatively, perhaps the user wants to separate based on whether the word's reading corresponds to an important kanji. So if the kanji in the word has high importance (based on the word's score), then it's important; otherwise, not.\n",
      "\n",
      "But this is getting a bit tangled. To simplify:\n",
      "\n",
      "- Important words: those with higher scores and more useful readings, like 'かかる' and 'かける.'\n",
      "- Not-important: '手掛り' and '掌け.'\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, but the importance scores are 3,2,3,2. So two have 3, which is medium-high.\n",
      "\n",
      "Perhaps I should include all as important since they have decent scores, but considering their usage:\n",
      "\n",
      "- 手掛り (てがかり): Noun, useful in specific contexts like handles.\n",
      "- 掛＊かる: Verb, high-frequency.\n",
      "- 掌け: Maybe less common or a variant.\n",
      "- 掛＊ける: Another verb form.\n",
      "\n",
      "But I'm not sure about '掌け.' It might be an error or less important. So perhaps:\n",
      "\n",
      "Important: 手掛り (3), 掌＊かる (2)\n",
      "Not-important: 掌け, 掛＊ける\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, but '掌＊かる' is the same as 'かかる,' which is 2, and '手掛り' is 3.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alternatively, maybe all should be considered important since they have scores above 2.\n",
      "\n",

      "1. 対抗 (たいこう, 3)\n",

      "Now, I'll go through each word to determine if it should be considered important or not.\n",
      "\n",
      "Starting with 対抗 (たいこう, 3). The importance score is 3 out of 5. It means 'opposition' or 'against'. Since the score is 3, which is moderate, and the reading is useful, I think this should be important because it's a common word and the kanji 対 can have other readings too.\n",
      "\n",
      "Next, 見物 (けいぶつ, 4). Importance score of 4. This means 'sightseeing' or 'things to see'. It's quite useful, especially in travel contexts. So this should definitely be important.\n",
      "\n",
      "火山 (かさん, 5) has a high importance score of 5. It means 'volcano', which is a fundamental word in geography and general vocabulary. Definitely important.\n",
      "\n",
      "電話 (でんわ, 5). Another score of 5. This is 'telephone' or 'phone call', an essential word for daily communication. Highly important.\n",
      "\n",
      "一番 (いちばん, 5). Importance 5 as well. It means 'number one' or 'the most'. A very common and versatile word, so it's crucial to include this.\n",
      "\n",
      "迅速 (じんそく, 4). Score of 4. This means 'quickly' or 'rapid'. Useful in both speaking and writing, so I'll mark this as important.\n",
      "\n",
      "Lastly, 一*つ (ひとつ, 4). The importance score is 4, but the reading is a bit unusual because it has a star which might indicate a variant or less common form. However, since the score is still high, it's better to include it in the important list.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, but the user mentioned that if a word isn't useful or doesn't represent an important reading, it should be learned later.

      "First, I need to understand the criteria for sorting. The important words are those that are useful and represent important readings.

      "\n",
      "Looking at the first entry: 机 (つくえ, 3). The importance score is 3, which I think is moderate. The word \"つくえ\" refers to a desk or table, which seems pretty common and useful. So this should be marked as important.\n",
      "\n",
      "Next up is 市 (いち, 4). With a score of 4, it's quite high. The reading \"いち\" means city or town, which is definitely a basic vocabulary word that many learners need. This one is also important.\n",

      "Then we have 明日 (あした, 2). The score is lower at 2, but \"あした\" is the word for tomorrow, which is essential in daily conversation. Even with a lower score, it's so common that it should be considered important.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, 私 (わたし, 5). This has a high importance score of 5, and it means I or me. It's one of the first words you learn when studying Japanese because it's used frequently. Definitely an important word.\n",
      "\n",
      "The last entry is 一*つ (ひとつ, 4). The asterisk here might be a typo or indicate something else, but regardless, the reading \"ひとつ\" is very useful meaning one or together. It's a common word in various contexts. So even though it has a high score, I can see why it would be important.\n",
      "\n",

      "Alright, I need to figure out how to sort these Japanese words into important and not-important categories based on their readings and importance scores. Let's break down each word one by one.\n",
      "\n",
      "First, looking at the list provided: \n",
      "\n",
      "1. お風呂 (おふろ, 5)\n",
      "2. 風邪 (かぜ, 4)\n",
      "3. 風 (ふう, 3)\n",
      "4. 風 (かぜ, 5)\n",
      "\n",
      "The user mentioned that words learned directly after the kanji should only be those that are useful and represent important readings. If a word isn't useful or doesn't show an important reading, it's better to learn it later.\n",
      "\n",
      "Let me analyze each entry:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **お風呂 (おふろ, 5)**: This is a common word meaning 'bath.' The kanji used here are 風 and 呂. However, the reading for 風 here isn't 'ふう' but part of the compound, so maybe it's not directly teaching the important readings. Still, it's a useful word in daily life.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **風邪 (かぜ, 4)**: This means 'cold' or 'flu.' The kanji 風 is used here with the reading 'かぜ,' which is a common and important reading for this character.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **風 (ふう, 3)**: This is a standalone word meaning 'wind.' The reading 'ふう' is less common compared to 'かぜ.' It's more of an alternative or literary reading.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **風 (かぜ, 5)**: Again, the kanji 風 but with the reading 'かぜ,' which is very common and important for this character.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, considering the importance scores:\n",
      "\n",
      "- The first word has a high score of 5, making it important.\n",
      "- Both 風邪 (4) and 风 (5) have high readings that are crucial for their respective kanji. However, since they both use 風 with different readings, but the user might prioritize teaching 'かぜ' first as it's more common.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, but each entry is a separate word with its own importance score. So:\n",
      "\n",
      "- お風呂 (5) should be important because it's high and useful.\n",
      "- 風邪 (4) is also high and represents the important reading 'かぜ.'\n",
      "- 风 (3) has a lower importance score, so maybe not as crucial to teach early.\n",
      "- The last one is 风 again with 'かぜ' but scored 5. However, since we already have 風邪 which teaches 'かぜ,' perhaps this standalone word might be redundant unless it's necessary.\n",
      "\n",
      "But wait, the user wants each kanji's important reading covered. So for 風, the readings are ふう and かぜ. The two entries with 风 (kanji) have different readings: one is ふう (3), the other かぜ (5). Since 'かぜ' is more common, it should be prioritized as important. Therefore, 風 (かぜ,5) would be in Important, and 風 (ふう,3) might go to Not-important.\n",
      "\n",
      "But wait, both entries are separate: one is the standalone word with ふう, the other is another instance of 风 with かぜ but as a different word. However, since the user provided two separate words for 风 with different readings and importance scores, I need to decide which ones to prioritize.\n",
      "\n",
      "Considering that 'かぜ' (as in 風邪) is more important and useful, it should be learned first. The standalone '風 (ふう)' might not be as immediately necessary unless someone needs the specific word meaning 'wind.' But given its lower score of 3, perhaps it's better to learn later.\n",
      "\n",
      "So compiling:\n",
      "\n",
      "Important: お風呂 (5), 風邪 (4), 风 (かぜ,5) → but wait, that might be too many. Wait, the user wants two lists with the kanji of the word. So each entry is a word, and I need to decide whether it's important or not.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait no: Looking back, the user provided four words, each with their own readings and scores. They want me to categorize them as Important or Not-important based on if they're useful and represent important readings.\n",
      "\n",
      "So:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. お風呂 (5): High score, useful word → Important\n",
      "2. 風邪 (4): Also high, teaches 'かぜ' which is key for the kanji 风 → Important\n",
      "3. 風 (3): Lower score, maybe not as crucial → Not-important\n",
      "4. 风 (5): Same kanji but same reading as 风邪? Wait no, it's another entry with the same kanji but different readings? Or is it the same kanji used differently?\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, looking again:\n",
      "\n",
      "The words are:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. お風呂 (kanji: 風 and 呂)\n",
      "2. 風邪 (kanji: 风 and 邪)\n",
      "3. 风 (kanji: 风 alone, reading 'ふう')\n",
      "4. 风 (kanji: 风 alone, reading 'かぜ')\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, no— actually, the user provided four separate words:\n",
      "\n",
      "- お風呂 is one word\n",
      "- 風邪 is another\n",
      "- 風 is a third\n",
      "- and another 风 with a different reading.\n",
      "\n",
      "But in the given list, each line is a separate word. So I need to decide for each word whether it's important or not based on its own score and utility.\n",
      "\n",
      "So:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. お風呂 (5): High score, useful → Important\n",
      "2. 風邪 (4): Also high and useful → Important\n",
      "3. 风 (3): Lower score, maybe less critical → Not-important\n",
      "4. 风 (5): Same kanji but same as the second word? Or is it a different context?\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait no, each entry is separate:\n",
      "\n",
      "- The third word is just '風' with reading 'ふう,' score 3.\n",
      "- The fourth word is also '風' but with reading 'かぜ,' score 5.\n",
      "\n",
      "Since both are separate words for 风 with different readings and scores. Now, the problem is that each represents a reading of the same kanji. So perhaps we should prioritize the one with the higher score. Since the fourth entry has a higher score (5), it's more important to learn 'かぜ' as it's more common. Therefore, the fourth word (風 かぜ 5) should be in Important, while the third (風 ふう 3) goes to Not-important.\n",
      "\n",
      "So compiling:\n",
      "\n",
      "Important: お風呂, 風邪, 风 (かぜ,5)\n",
      "\n",
      "Not-important: 风 (ふう,3)\n",
      "\n",
      "But wait, the user wants each word categorized based on their own merits. So perhaps it's better to consider each word individually regardless of kanji overlap.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alternatively, considering that both 風邪 and 风 (かぜ) are using the same kanji but different readings, maybe one is sufficient for teaching the important reading 'かぜ.' Since they are separate words, though, I think they should both be considered separately.\n",
      "\n",
      "But to avoid redundancy, perhaps only include each important word once. So:\n",
      "\n",
      "Important: お風呂 (5), 風邪 (4), 风 (かぜ,5)\n",
      "\n",
      "Not-important: 风 (ふう,3)\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, but that's three in Important and one in Not-important, which might be acceptable.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alternatively, perhaps the user expects each kanji to have at least one important word. Since 風 appears multiple times, maybe only one is needed for 'かぜ.'\n",
      "\n",
      "But since they are separate words with different readings, both could be considered as separate entries. However, given their scores, the fourth word (5) is more important than the third (3).\n",
      "\n",
      "So perhaps:\n",
      "\n",
      "Important: お風呂, 風邪, 风 (かぜ,5)\n",
      "\n",
      "Not-important: 风 (ふう,3)\n",
      "\n",
      "But I need to ensure each entry is a separate word.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait no, in the user's list:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. お風呂\n",
      "2. 風邪\n",
      "3. 風 (reading 'ふう')\n",
      "4. 风 (reading 'かぜ')\n",
      "\n",
      "Each are separate words with their own scores.\n",
      "\n",
      "Thus, for categorization:\n",
      "\n",
      "- 1: High score → Important\n",
      "- 2: High score → Important\n",
      "- 3: Lower score → Not-important\n",
      "- 4: Highest score → Important\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait but that would make three in Important and one in Not. But I think the user expects a split where some are important based on their own merit.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alternatively, perhaps 'お風呂' is less crucial than others? No, it's a high-frequency word meaning 'bath.' So it's useful.\n",
      "\n",
      "So perhaps all except 风 (ふう) go to Important.\n",
      "\n",

      "Let me look at each word provided:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. 根拠 (こんきょ, 1): The importance score here is low (1). It's a compound kanji, so it's likely better to learn later unless it's absolutely essential.\n",
      "2. 具体的 (ぐったくでき, 3): This has a moderate importance score. It might be useful in certain contexts but not the most critical reading for the kanji.\n",
      "3. 二日 (ふつか, 4): With a higher score of 4, this seems important because it's a basic word and likely teaches a primary reading of the kanji.\n",
      "4. 三日 (みっか, 3): Another moderate score. It might be useful but perhaps secondary to other readings.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, but each of these words is a separate entry with its own kanji. So I need to look at each kanji's readings and decide which word(s) represent the most important ones.\n",
      "\n",
      "For example:\n",
      "- 根拠: The main reading is こんきょ (meaning basis or foundation). If this is the primary reading, then maybe it should be Important.\n",
      "- 具体的: Mainly used as an adjective meaning specific. With a score of 3, perhaps Not-important unless it's a key reading.\n",
      "- 二日: Mainly means two days. High importance (4), so likely Important.\n",
      "- 三日: Means three days, with a score of 3. Since 二日 is higher and more basic, maybe 三日 can be Not-important.\n",
      "\n",
      "But wait, each entry seems to have its own kanji. Maybe I'm misunderstanding. Perhaps each word is tied to one or more kanji? Or each word is an example for the kanji it contains. For instance, 根拠 has two kanji: 根 and 拠. But if I'm supposed to list the words by their kanji, maybe I need to check which kanji each word uses.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, perhaps the user provided a list of words with their readings and scores, and each word contains certain kanji. My job is to assign each word to either Important or Not-important based on whether they're essential for learning the primary reading of their kanji.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, for example:\n",
      "- 根拠 (こんきょ) uses kanji 根 and 拠. If this word represents an important reading for either kanji, it should go into Important.\n",
      "- 具体的 (ぐったくでき): Maybe it's a key term in Japanese, so perhaps important.\n",
      "- 二日 (ふつか): Definitely important as it's a basic word.\n",
      "- 三日 (みっか): Also important but maybe less than 二日.\n",
      "\n",
      "But the user wants the output to list the words by their kanji. So for each kanji, I need to decide which word(s) are important. Wait, no—the output is just two lists: Important and Not-important, each containing the words as given, not per kanji.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, perhaps the confusion arises because each word has multiple kanji, but the user wants to sort all the provided words into these two categories based on their importance for teaching the primary reading of at least one kanji. So if a word's reading is essential for a kanji it contains, it goes to Important; otherwise, Not-important.\n",
      "\n",
      "Let me go through each word:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. 根拠 (こんきょ): This word uses two kanji: 根 and 拠. If こんきょ is the primary reading taught by these kanji, then it should be Important. The score is 1, which might suggest lower importance, but since it's a compound, perhaps each component needs its own important word.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. 具体的 (ぐったくでき): This uses kanji 具 and 的. If this reading is essential for either kanji, then it should be Important.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. 二日 (ふつか): Uses kanji 二 and 日. ふつか is a primary reading for 二, so this word should definitely be Important.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. 三日 (みっか): Uses kanji 三 and 日. Since 三日 is another primary reading but maybe less common than にち (for 日), it might still be considered important but perhaps lower priority compared to 二日.\n",
      "\n",
      "But the instructions say that some words are learned directly after the kanji if they're useful or represent important readings, else later. So for each kanji in a word, check if the reading is primary. If yes, then the word should be Important; otherwise, Not-important.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, I'm not sure about all the primary readings off the top of my head. For example:\n",
      "\n",
      "- 根: Common readings are こん (as in 根拠) and ね (as in 根本). So 根拠's reading is one of the main ones for 根.\n",
      "- 拠: Less common, so perhaps its primary reading is in 根拠.\n",
      "- 具: Common as ぐ (in 具体的).\n",
      "- 的: Common as てき, but in 具体的 it's でき, which might be less common.\n",
      "- 二: Primary readings are に and じ. ふつか uses に.\n",
      "- 日: Primary readings are にち, ひ, etc. In 二日, 日 is read as にち.\n",
      "\n",
      "So considering this:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. 根拠 (こんきょ): Important for both kanji, especially since it's a common reading.\n",
      "2. 具体的 (ぐったくでき): Maybe important for 具 but less so for 的, which might have other primary readings elsewhere.\n",
      "3. 二日 (ふつか): Definitely important as it uses the primary reading of 二 and 日.\n",
      "4. 三日 (みっか): Important but perhaps lower priority than 二日.\n",
      "\n",
      "So sorting them:\n",
      "\n",
      "Important: 根拠、具具体的、二日\n",
      "Not-important: 三日\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, but the importance scores are given as well. The user provided a score from 0-5. For example, 根拠 has a score of 1, which might make it less important than others with higher scores.\n",
      "\n",
      "So maybe I should prioritize words based on both their score and whether they represent primary readings.\n",
      "\n",
      "Looking back:\n",
      "\n",
      "- 根拠 (1): Lower score but still useful for its kanji.\n",
      "- 具体的 (3): Moderate score, perhaps more important.\n",
      "- 二日 (4): High score, definitely important.\n",
      "- 三日 (3): Moderate but maybe less critical than 二日.\n",
      "\n",
      "So perhaps:\n",
      "\n",
      "Important: 具体的、二日\n",
      "Not-important: 根拠、三日\n",
      "\n",
      "But I'm not entirely sure because the user's instructions mention that at least one word should always be important to cover the most important reading. So if a kanji only has one primary reading, the corresponding word must be in Important.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, perhaps each kanji in the words needs its own evaluation. But without knowing all the primary readings for each kanji, it's challenging.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alternatively, maybe I can make judgments based on commonality:\n",
      "\n",
      "- 二日 (ふつか) is a very common word and likely teaches an important reading of both 二 and 日.\n",
      "- 具体的 (ぐったくでき) is also a common word in Japanese, so probably important for 具.\n",
      "- 根拠 is less commonly used as a standalone word, perhaps making it lower priority.\n",
      "- 三日 is less critical than 二日 but still useful.\n",
      "\n",
      "So finalizing:\n",
      "\n",
      "Important: 具体的、二日\n",
      "Not-important: 根拠、三日\n",
      "\n",
      "But considering the scores again, since 二日 has a high score of 4, definitely important. 具体的 with 3 might be more important than 根拠 (1). So yes, that makes sense.\n",

      "\n",
      "Starting with 殺*す (ころす). The kanji here is 殺, which means \"to kill\" or \"to slay.\" The reading provided is ころす, but another common reading is 殺う(korosu), which is very fundamental and appears in many contexts. However, the word given is 殺*す, so I need to consider its importance. It's a verb form meaning to kill, so it's quite useful.\n",
      "\n",
      "Next, 自殺 (じさつ) means \"suicide.\" This is also an important word because it's a common term and introduces another reading of 殻 (sa). But since the user provided this as a separate word, I need to see if it should be learned directly after the kanji or later.\n",
      "\n",
      "Lastly, 殺人 (さつじん) means \"murder\" or \"homicide.\" This is also important because it's another common term and uses the same kanji but in a different context. It helps reinforce the meaning of 殻 as related to killing.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, considering the criteria: words that are learned directly after the kanji should be useful and represent important readings. Since all three have high importance scores (4), they're all quite significant. \n",
      "\n",
      "However, I should ensure that at least one word is learned immediately to cover the most important reading of the kanji 殻. The reading ころす is a core form, but 自殺 and 殺人 introduce additional readings and contexts.\n",
      "\n",
      "I think it's best to categorize all three as important because each contributes differently. 殺*す provides the basic verb form, 自殺 introduces another common noun with a different context, and 殺人 shows the kanji in another essential term. This way, each word reinforces different aspects of the kanji.\n",

      "Alright, so I'm trying to figure out how to sort these Japanese words based on their importance for flashcards. The user has provided two words: 支払い (しはらい, score 0) and 支＊える (ささえる, score 4). \n",
      "\n",
      "First, I need to understand the criteria. The important words should be those that are useful and represent important readings of the kanji. If a word isn't useful or doesn't show an important reading, it should be learned later.\n",
      "\n",
      "Looking at the first word: 支払い (しはらい) with a score of 0. The kanji here is 支. I know that 支 can have multiple readings like しそう (shibou), じ (ji), and しづ (jizuku). However, 支払 in this case is pronounced しはらい, which is a common word meaning 'payment' or 'to pay'. This seems useful because it's frequently used in daily language. \n",
      "\n",
      "The second word: 支＊える (ささえる) with a score of 4. The kanji here is also 支, but the reading is ささえる. This verb means to support or prop up something. It's another important reading for the same kanji, so learning this would help in understanding different contexts where 支 appears.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, considering the importance scores, both words have different scores. The second word has a higher score (4), indicating it's more important. However, usefulness also plays a role. Both are useful but in different contexts—financial terms and physical support.\n",
      "\n",
      "I think that since both readings of 支 are important for understanding its usage in various situations, they should be considered. But the user mentioned that not all words need to be initially learned if they're less important. However, at least one word per kanji should be important enough to cover the primary reading.\n",
      "\n",
      "In this case, 支払い (しはらい) might be more commonly used, making it essential. The second word is also crucial for understanding another key meaning and reading of the same kanji. So both could be considered important, but based on their scores, ささえる has a higher score, suggesting it's more vital.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, but the user said to sort them into important or not. Since 支払い has a lower score (0), maybe it's less critical, while 支＊える with a higher score is more important. Alternatively, perhaps both are important because they cover different readings of the same kanji.\n",
      "\n",
      "I think I should prioritize the word that teaches an important reading for the kanji. Both words do that, but since ささえる has a higher importance score, it's likely to be more critical. However, 支払い is also commonly used and might be essential as well.\n",
      "\n",
      "Hmm, maybe I should consider both as important because they each teach different readings of the same kanji, which are both useful in their contexts. But given the scores, perhaps ささえる (4) is more so than 支払い (0). Alternatively, since 0 might mean less important, maybe only ささえる is important.\n",
      "\n",
      "But I'm a bit confused because 0 doesn't necessarily mean unimportant; it's just scored lower. Maybe I should look at the kanji usage and frequency. 支払い is more common in financial contexts, so perhaps it's more useful for learners. \n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, but the user said that even if a kanji isn't very important, as long as one word is important enough to cover the main reading, others can be learned later. So maybe both are important because they each represent key readings of 支.\n",

      "On the other hand, 予約 is \"reservation,\" which is also very common. It's used frequently in contexts like making reservations at restaurants or hotels. The reading \"よやく\" is a standard and important reading for these kanji.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, considering their importance scores, both are above average (3 and 4). However, the user wants me to sort them into two lists. Since they're both quite useful, I might prioritize both as important. But given that one has a slightly higher score, maybe 予約 should be in the Important list while 予報 could go into Not-important if necessary.\n",
      "\n",

However, it's not a word that comes up often in everyday conversation.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, considering the kanji here: 矛 is \"hoko\" (spear), and 先 is \"saki\" (front, tip). Since both kanji are being used to form this word, I should evaluate if learning this word directly after the kanji would be beneficial. If the goal is to learn important readings, then a word like 矛先 might not add much because it's quite niche.\n",

      "Additionally, looking at the importance score of 0, which likely indicates that it's less commonly used or has limited practical value in modern Japanese.

      "Okay, let's see what I have here. The user has provided two Japanese words with their readings and importance scores. They want me to sort them into important and not-important categories based on whether they should be learned directly after the kanji or later.\n",
      "\n",
      "First, I need to understand the criteria. Important words are those that are useful and represent significant readings of the kanji. If a word isn't useful or doesn't capture an important reading, it's better suited for later learning. Also, each kanji should have at least one important word, especially if it's a primary reading.\n",
      "\n",
      "Looking at the first word: 音痴 (おんち, 2). The kanji here are 音 and 痴. 音 primarily means sound or music-related. 遣 is another reading for 音, but おん is more common. So 音痴 might not be the most essential word to learn because it's less commonly used.\n",
      "\n",
      "Next, 愚痴 (ぐち, 2). The kanji are 愚 and 痴. 愚 means foolish or unintelligent, and 痴 can mean madness or傻. However, 愚痴 is a noun meaning \"foolishness\" or \"stupidity.\" It's used in some contexts, but it might not be the first word one would learn for these kanji. \n",
      "\n",
      "Now, considering their importance scores are both 2 out of 5. Since they're relatively low, it suggests that these words aren't as crucial as others with higher scores. Therefore, it makes sense to categorize them as not-important because there might be more useful or commonly used words associated with the same kanji elsewhere.\n",

      "Alright, I need to figure out how to sort the provided Japanese words into \"Important\" and \"Not-important\" categories based on their usefulness and importance scores. The user has given me two words:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. 麻痺 (まひ, score 0)\n",
      "2. 痺＊れる (しびれる, score 1)\n",
      "\n",
      "First, I'll analyze each word's kanji and reading to determine their importance.\n",
      "\n",
      "Starting with \"麻痺 (まひ)\". The kanji here is 麻痺. Breaking it down, 麻 means hemp or nettle, and 病 means disease or illness. So together, 麻痺 refers to a condition where there's a loss of sensation or muscle function due to something like a stroke or nerve damage. This word is quite common in medical contexts but might not be frequently used in everyday conversation. However, it does have an important reading \"まひ,\" which should be learned early because knowing the readings for kanji is crucial for expanding vocabulary.\n",
      "\n",
      "Next, 痺＊れる (しびれる). The main kanji here is 病, which I already know means disease or illness. This word seems to be a verb form, possibly meaning something like \"to fall ill\" or \"to get sick.\" The importance score here is 1, which is higher than the first word's score of 0. Since this word has an important kanji and a useful reading, it should also be learned early.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, considering the criteria: words that represent important readings for their kanji should be in the \"Important\" category. Both 麻痺 and 病＊れる are tied to the kanji 病 (病) and 麻痺's own kanji combination. However, 麻痺 has a score of 0, which might suggest it's less critical compared to the second word with a higher score.\n",
      "\n",
      "But wait, I should check if these words cover the main readings for their respective kanji. For 麻痺, \"まひ\" is an important reading because it's a common way to express that meaning. Even though the score is 0, it still might be essential to include it as it represents a primary reading of the kanji combination.\n",
      "\n",
      "For 病＊れる, the score is higher (1), making it more important and likely used in everyday contexts more than 麻痺. However, I should ensure that at least one word with an important reading is included for each kanji, but since both share the same base kanji, perhaps prioritizing the one with a higher score makes sense.\n",
      "\n",
      "But wait again—麻痺 is its own unique kanji combination (麻 + 病), while 病＊れる uses only the 病 kanji. So each word corresponds to different kanji usages. Therefore, both should be considered individually for their importance in representing their respective kanji's primary readings.\n",
      "\n",
      "Since 麻痺 has a score of 0 but is a common term related to its kanji, it might still be important. However, the user mentioned that if the score is low, it can go into \"Not-important.\" But I have to balance that with ensuring that at least one word per kanji is important.\n",
      "\n",
      "But actually, each word here represents a different aspect: 麻痺 as a noun and 病＊れる as a verb. Since they both are tied to the 病 part but in different contexts, perhaps only one needs to be prioritized. Given that 病＊れる has a higher score, it might take precedence.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, no. Each word is separate, so each should be evaluated on its own merits regardless of the other. So for 麻痺: kanji combination, reading \"まひ,\" and score 0. For 病＊れる: kanji 病, reading \"しびれる,\" score 1.\n",
      "\n",
      "Considering that both are tied to their respective readings, I think both should be in the Important category because they represent key readings for their kanji, even if one has a lower importance score than the other.\n",
      "\n",
      "But maybe the user's instruction is to prioritize words with higher scores. Since 病＊れる has a higher score (1 vs 0), it might be more important to include that first, while 麻痺 could be considered less important or delayed. However, I have to ensure that at least one word per kanji is included as important.\n",
      "\n",
      "But in this case, each word represents different kanji usages: 麻痺 uses two kanji (麻 and 病), while 病＊れる only uses 病. So perhaps both should be considered for their respective kanji's primary readings. However, the user might want to prioritize the higher-scored word first.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alternatively, if the score is more indicative of importance, then 病＊れる (score 1) would go into Important, and 麻痺 (score 0) into Not-important. But I'm not entirely sure because sometimes even a low score might indicate it's still useful for the kanji's main reading.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, the user said: \"The words that are learned directly after the kanji should only be words that are useful and words that represent important readings.\" So if a word is useful for an important reading, include it in Important; otherwise, Not-important.\n",
      "\n",
      "Given that both words might represent important readings of their kanji, even with lower scores, but since 病＊れる has a higher score, perhaps it's more essential. However, I'm confused because the user's example response had only one word as Important and none as Not-important, which doesn't align here.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait no—the user provided an example where both were in the Important category. So maybe despite the lower scores, if they represent important readings, they should be included.\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "First, let's go through each word one by one.\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **霜 (しも, 3)**: The reading is \"shimo,\" which refers to frost. It's a natural phenomenon, so I think it's useful because understanding seasonal terms can be important in literature or daily conversation. The importance score is 3, which isn't the highest but still decent.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **霜 (しらう, 5)**: Another reading for 霜 is \"shirau.\" This might refer to something white like snow or frost. Since it's a different meaning and has a higher importance score of 5, it's more critical to include this as important.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **蛇 (へび, 4)**: The word 蛇 means snake. Snakes are common in stories and conversations, so knowing this kanji is useful. With an importance score of 4, it definitely should be considered important.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **蛇 (じゃ, 2)**: This is another reading for 蛇, which might be less common or used in specific contexts like \"じゃ\" being a term I'm not as familiar with. The lower importance score of 2 suggests it's less critical and can go into Not-important.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **蛇 (へび＊, 1)**: This is the same kanji but with an alternative reading marked by * and a low score of 1. It's probably a less common or variant pronunciation, so it doesn't need to be prioritized.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. **蛇 (じゃ＊, 3)**: Another variant reading with a slightly higher score of 3. Even though the score is moderate, since there's already an important \"shimo\" and \"hebi,\" this might still be better suited for later learning.\n",
      "\n",
      "7. **蛇 (にじゃ＊, 2)**: This has the highest importance score at 5 but wait, no—the scores here are listed as 1 each for some. Wait, looking back, I think I may have confused the numbers. Let me check again.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait a minute, perhaps I made an error earlier. Each line should be evaluated individually. So \"霜 (しも, 3)\" is important because it's a common term with a decent score. Then \"霜 (しらう, 5)\" definitely is important due to the high score. For 蛇, there are multiple readings: \"へび\" and \"じゃ.\" Since \"へび\" is more commonly used and has a higher score of 4, it's important. The other readings with lower scores or asterisks can be considered not as crucial.\n",
      "\n",
      "So putting it together:\n",
      "\n",
      "Important should include 霧 (きり, 1) because even though the score is low, it's the only one provided for that kanji. Also, 霜 (しも, 3), 霜 (しらう, 5), and 蛇 (へび, 4). \n",
      "\n",
      "Not-important would be the other readings: 霧 with the same kanji but no additional info, 霜 (しらう, 5) is already included, so perhaps I need to recheck.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, maybe I overcomplicated it. Let me list each word as given and decide based on their own merits.\n",
      "\n",
      "Looking at all words:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. 霧 (きり, 1): Common word for mist, useful, so important.\n",
      "2. 霧 (＊きり, 3): Alternative reading, less common but still somewhat useful, maybe not as crucial.\n",
      "3. 霧 (きり＊, 5): High importance score, definitely important.\n",
      "\n",
      "For 霜:\n",
      "\n",
      "4. 霜 (しも, 3): Important due to the meaning and moderate score.\n",
      "5. 霜 (しらう, 5): Very important because of high score.\n",
      "6. 霜 (＊しらう, 2): Lower score, not as important.\n",
      "\n",
      "For 蛇:\n",
      "\n",
      "7. 蛇 (へび, 4): Important because it's a common word with a decent score.\n",
      "8. 蛇 (じゃ, 2): Less important due to lower score and possibly less common use.\n",
      "9. 蛇 (へび＊, 1): Variant reading with low score, not important.\n",
      "10. 蛇 (じゃ＊, 3): Slightly higher but still, other readings are more critical.\n",
      "11. 蛇 (にじゃ＊, 2): Seems like a less common or alternative form.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, I think the user provided all words under each kanji. So for 霧, there are three entries: two with different readings and one with an asterisk, etc. \n",

      "\n",
      "First, I should recall what the kanji in these words mean. 悪 is \"evil\" or \"bad,\" and 霊 can mean \"spirit\" or \"ghost.\" So 悪霧 likely refers to an evil spirit. The reading for 悪霧 is あくりょう, which I think might be a less common way to read that kanji combination.\n",
      "\n",
      "Next, 霊感 has the kanji 霊 and 感. 霊 is \"spirit\" or \"ghost,\" and 感 is \"feeling\" or \"sense.\" So 霊感 means \"spiritual feeling\" or \"sensitivity.\" The reading is れいかん, which I'm more familiar with because 霊感 is a common term in Japanese for things like spiritual awareness.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, looking at the importance scores. Both words have a score of 1. However, when it comes to learning kanji and vocabulary, priority is usually given to readings that are more common or foundational. 霊感 seems more widely used than 悪霧. Also, the reading \"れいかん\" might be more essential for understanding other contexts where 霊 appears.\n",
      "\n",
      "I should also consider if either of these words represents an important reading for their respective kanji. For 悪, あくりょう isn't as common as other readings like 悪い (akuī), which is used in many compounds. Similarly, for 霊, the reading れいかん might be one of the primary ones taught early on.\n",
      "\n",
      "Given that both have a low importance score, I'm leaning towards considering them Not-important, especially since they might not cover the most essential readings for their kanji. However, the user mentioned that at least one word should be important to learn the main reading. But in this case, since both are scored equally and neither seems crucial, perhaps it's acceptable to mark them as Not-important.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, but if both have low scores and aren't critical for the primary readings of their kanji, maybe they should indeed go into Not-important. However, I need to ensure that at least one word is important to cover an essential reading. Maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Since their importance scores are both 1, which is lower than other possible scores (up to 5), perhaps they are considered less important.\n",

      "Starting with 薬局: It's a common word in Japanese, especially useful in daily life. Pharmacies are common places, so knowing this word could be immediately helpful. The reading \"yakkyoku\" is also a standard reading for the kanji 薬 and 局. Since the importance score is 2, which isn't too low, it makes sense to include it as important.\n",
      "\n",
      "Next, 郵便局: This means post office. While useful, it might be slightly less common than a pharmacy depending on context. The reading \"yubinkyoku\" is also standard for these kanji. With an importance score of 3, which is higher than the first word, it's still quite important but perhaps not as critical as the first.\n",

      "However, the user's instruction says that at least one word should be important to learn the most important reading. Both words have \"きょく\" (kyoku) as part of their readings, but each has a different kanji combination.

      "Next is 調整 (ちょうせい, 3). This word means adjustment or regulation and is used in both business and everyday contexts. The reading is ちょうせい, which could be a key on'yomi for 管. Given the higher score of 3, it's likely important to learn this early as it's widely applicable.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then we have 遊び (あそび, 2). This word means play or game and is fundamental in Japanese vocabulary, especially when talking about activities and hobbies. The reading あそび is a common kun'yomi for the kanji 遊, making it essential to learn early on.\n",
      "\n",
      "The fourth word is 河流 (かわる, 2). It refers to river currents or streams. While useful, it's more specialized and might not be as commonly used in everyday conversation. The reading かわる is a kun'yomi for 川, but since the score is low, perhaps it's better suited for later learning.\n",
      "\n",
      "Lastly, 装備 (そうび, 4). This word means equipment or gear and is often used in contexts like sports or military. The reading そうび is an on'yomi for 武, and with a higher importance score of 4, it seems important enough to be learned early as it's versatile.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, considering the criteria: words that are useful and represent important readings should go into \"Important\". Words that are less useful or don't showcase key readings go to \"Not-important\".\n",
      "\n",
      "陶器 is somewhat common but with a low score, maybe it's better to hold off on it. 調整 is highly applicable and has a high reading importance. 遊び is fundamental for its kanji. 河流 might be better learned later as it's less common. 装備, being versatile and with a higher score, should be important.\n",

      "Wait, no, looking again: 印鑑 is いんかん, which uses the kanji 鑑, 図鑑 also uses 鑑, and then 鉱定 and 鉱賞 use 鉱. So perhaps there are two different kanji here: 鑷 (kan) and 鉱 (kan). That might be a mistake because they both have the same reading but different meanings.\n",
      "\n",
      "Assuming that's correct, I'll proceed with that. \n",
      "\n",
      "Now, considering each word:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. 印鑑 (いんかん, 3): This is a common word meaning \"stamp\" or \"impression.\" It's widely used in Japan for official documents, so it's quite important. The score here is 3, which is mid to high.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. 図鑑 (ずかん, 2): This means \"picture book\" or \"illustrated manual.\" It's useful but maybe not as essential as 印鑑. The score of 2 indicates it's somewhat important but perhaps less so than others.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. 鉱定 (かんてい, 1): If the kanji is 鉅, which relates to mining, then this word would be \"mining exploration\" or something similar. It's a specialized term and probably not commonly used unless in specific contexts. The score of 1 suggests it's less important.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. 鉱賞 (かんしょう, 1): This might mean \"mineral appreciation\" or something along those lines. Again, quite specialized, so likely not essential for general learning. Score is also 1.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, the user wants to separate these into Important and Not-important categories. The Important list should include words that are useful and represent important readings of their kanji. \n",
      "\n",
      "Looking at the first two, 印鑑 (いんかん) uses the kanji 鉷 with a high score, so it's definitely important. 図鑑 (ずかん) also uses 鉷 but has a lower score. However, since 3 is still relatively high, perhaps it should be considered as well. \n",
      "\n",
      "The last two use 鉱 and have low scores. Since they're less common and their readings are probably not essential for understanding the kanji's primary meanings, they can be placed in Not-important.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, but if the kanji is different (鑑 vs 鉱), perhaps each kanji should be considered separately. So 印鑑 teaches 鑇, which is a high-use kanji. 図鑑 also uses 颼, so maybe it's better to include both of those as important since they teach two readings of the same kanji: いん and ず. But wait, actually, no—印鑑 is いんかん, which would be the on'yomi for 颼, while 図鑑 uses ずかん, which might be a different reading or perhaps a different kanji? Wait, no—the user provided 図鑑 as ずかん, so it's using 龙 with the same reading.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, but I'm getting confused. Let me clarify:\n",
      "\n",
      "- 印鑑: いんかん (kan) — uses 颼.\n",
      "- 図鑑: ずかん — uses 龍? Wait no, that doesn't make sense. Maybe it's 龙 with the reading ずかん. Or perhaps it's a different kanji.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, no— 図鑑 is actually read as ずかん, and the kanji is 図 (zu) and 鉷 (kan). So 図 is from 図, which means \"picture,\" and 鉷 is the same as in 印鑑. So both words use 鉷, but with different readings.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, so in this case, the user provided four words:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. 印鑑 (いんかん) — uses 颼.\n",
      "2. 図鑑 (ずかん) — uses 龙? Or is it a different kanji?\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, I'm getting more confused. Let me check each word's actual kanji.\n",
      "\n",
      "- 印鑑: 印 is \"seal\" or \"impression,\" and 鉷 is the same as in 図鑑.\n",
      "- 図鑑: 図 means \"picture\" or \"diagram,\" and 鉷 is again the same kanji, but pronounced かん here.\n",
      "\n",
      "So both words use the same kanji 遣 but with different readings. So 印鑑 uses いんかん (on'yomi), while 図鑑 uses ずかん (also on'yomi? Or maybe a combination). Wait, no—図 is from 図, which is usually read as \"zu\" in on'yomi and はがき in kun'yomi. So 図鑑 would be 図 (zu) + 鉷 (kan), making it ずかん.\n",
      "\n",
      "So both 印鑑 and 図鑑 use the kanji 遣, but with different readings: いん and ず. Therefore, these two words are crucial for learning the on'yomi of 遣, which is a common kanji. \n",
      "\n",
      "The other two words, 鉱定 (かんてい) and 鉱賞 (かんしょう), use the kanji 鉅 with readings かん、てい, and かん、しょう. These are probably more specialized terms, likely used in specific contexts like geology or mineralogy. Since their scores are lower (1 each), they're less important for general learning.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, considering all this:\n",
      "\n",
      "Important words should be those that teach the most useful readings of the kanji. Both 印鑑 and 図鑑 use 遣 with high importance scores (3 and 2). Therefore, these two should be in the Important list because they represent essential readings of the kanji.\n",
      "\n",
      "The other two words, 鉱定 and 鉅賞, use a different kanji (鉱) which is less common, so they can be placed in Not-important.\n",
      "\n",
      "Therefore, the final lists would be:\n",
      "\n",
      "Important: 印鑑 図鑑\n",
      "Not-important: 鉱定 鉲赏\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, but the user wrote \"＊\" in some words. Oh, looking back, no, the user didn't include any asterisks in this case. So all words are just as provided.\n",
      "\n",

      "First, 御免なさい (ごめんなさい) has an importance score of 1. The kanji here is 御, which means 'honorific' or 'respectful.' This word is a polite way to say \"I'm sorry\" or \"Excuse me.\" It's pretty common in daily conversation, so it's useful for learners to understand this reading early on.\n",
      "\n",
      "Next up is 御覧 (ごらん) with an importance score of 2. The kanji here are 御 and 観, which together mean 'to watch' or 'to see.' This word is also quite useful in polite contexts, like when asking someone to look at something. It's a good foundational word for learners.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then there's 御手洗い (おてあらい), scored at 3. The kanji here are 御 and 手洗い. This term refers to washing hands and is often used in polite situations, such as before eating or visiting someone. It's practical and useful, especially in social settings.\n",
      "\n",
      "Looking at the importance scores, all three words have scores between 1 and 3. Since the user mentioned that if a word is not useful or doesn't represent an important reading, it should be learned later, but I need to prioritize those that are more essential. However, each of these words seems to serve an important purpose in polite communication.\n",
      "\n",
      "御免なさい (ごめんなさい) is essential for apologizing or excusing oneself, which is a common scenario. 御覧 (ごらん) is also frequently used when asking someone to look at something, making it quite handy. 御手洗い (おてあらい) teaches the action of washing hands, which is both polite and practical.\n",
      "\n",
      "I don't see any words here that are particularly less useful or non-representative of important readings. Each word contributes to understanding different aspects of Japanese culture and communication. Therefore, all three should be considered important for learners at this stage.\n",

      "I should go through each word provided by the user and assess its usefulness based on frequency in Japanese, how well it represents the main readings of the kanji, and the importance score given. Words with higher scores are likely more important, but I shouldn't rely solely on that; context and common usage matter too.\n",

      "Looking at the given words: 畳 (たたみ, 2) and 畳 (じょう, 1). The score for たたみ is higher than じょう. In Japanese, たたみ typically refers to a tatami mat, which is a common word used in daily conversation.

      "\n",
      "First up is \"神様\" (かみさま, 5). The reading here is かみさま, and the importance score is 5. This is a common term for God in Japanese, so it's definitely important. I should include this in the Important list.\n",
      "\n",
      "Next is \"神\" itself (かみ, 3). Since this is just the kanji by itself, and the reading is crucial, especially since 神 is a fundamental kanji, this should also be marked as important to learn its basic meaning and pronunciation.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then we have \"神道\" (しんとう, 3). This refers to Shinto, the indigenous religion of Japan. It's significant because it relates to an important cultural aspect, so this word should go into Important as well.\n",
      "\n",
      "Moving on to \"神社\" (じんじゃ, 2). This is a Shinto shrine, and while it's related to 神, the score here is lower at 2. However, understanding this term is still useful because it's commonly encountered in Japan, so I'm leaning towards including it as important.\n",
      "\n",
      "Lastly, \"神秘的\" (しんぴてき, 1). This means mysterious or mystical and has a lower importance score of 1. While it's an adjective that might come up less often, it's still somewhat useful but perhaps not as critical as the others. However, since all words are related to 神, even this one could be considered important for completeness.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, the instructions say that some words should be learned directly after the kanji if they're useful and represent important readings. So I need to ensure that at least one word per kanji is important, especially for its most critical reading.\n",
      "\n",
      "Looking back, \"神\" (かみ) has another possible reading: じん, but in this list, it's given as かみ, which is the primary and more common reading. Therefore, learning 神 directly with its main reading is essential.\n",
      "\n",
      "For \"神様\", it's a compound that uses the same kanji but adds politeness or formality, so it's definitely important. Similarly, \"神道\" and \"神社\" are key terms in understanding Shinto culture, which is significant in Japan.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"神秘的\" might be less commonly used, but since it's part of the list with a score of 1, I think it's still better to include it as important because it adds depth to vocabulary related to 神. Plus, even though it's lower, it's another way the kanji is read.\n",

      "First, I should understand the structure of the data given. Each entry is a kanji followed by its readings and an importance score. For example, 富 has two readings: とみ with a score of 1 and 富＊む (and another reading とむ also with a score of 1). \n",

      "I need to decide for each kanji which of its readings are important enough to be considered primary. The importance score ranges from 0 to 5, so higher scores indicate more importance. However, the user mentioned that even if a word is classified as important, if the kanji isn't very important, it's acceptable for the words to have lower priority.\n",
      "\n",
      "Looking at 富: \n",
      "- 富 (とみ) has an importance score of 1.\n",
      "- 富＊む (and 富＊む with とむ) also has a score of 1. \n",
      "\n",
      "Since both readings have the same low importance, I might consider whether either is more essential or commonly used. とみ is a common reading for 富 meaning \"richness\" or \"wealth,\" while とむ isn't as standard. However, since both have the same score, perhaps only one should be marked as important.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, but according to the user's example response, both are placed in Not-important. Maybe because their importance scores are low, and they might not be the most crucial readings for 富. But I'm not entirely sure. Do I need to prioritize based on which reading is more likely to be taught first? Or just strictly follow the score?\n",
      "\n",
      "I think the key point is that at least one word should represent the most important reading. In this case, both have a score of 1, so maybe either can be chosen as important. But in the example response provided by the user, they categorized both as Not-important. That might mean that the importance scores are too low for them to be considered essential.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alternatively, perhaps the presence of multiple readings with the same kanji suggests that one should be prioritized. Maybe 富 (とみ) is more standard, so it's important, while 富＊む is less common and thus not as important. But in the example, both are under Not-important, which contradicts that thought.\n",
      "\n",
      "I'm a bit confused here. The user's example might indicate that when multiple readings have low importance scores, they should all be categorized as Not-important. So perhaps I should follow that approach.\n",

      "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how to sort these Japanese words into important and not-important categories based on their readings and importance scores. The user has provided three words: 初めまして (はじめまして, 5), 初＊め (はじめ, 3), and 初＊めて (はじめて, 4). \n",
      "\n",
      "First, I need to understand the task. The goal is to create flashcards where some words are learned directly after their kanji, and others later. The important ones should be those that are useful and represent key readings of the kanji.\n",
      "\n",
      "Looking at the first word: 初めまして (はじめまして, 5). This is a common expression meaning \"Nice to meet you.\" It's definitely an important phrase because it's used frequently in daily conversation. The kanji here is 初 (はつ), which means 'first'. Since this word uses 初 and has a high importance score of 5, it should be considered important.\n",
      "\n",
      "Next, 初＊め (はじめ, 3). This is another reading for the same kanji 初. It's also quite common, used in words like 初めて (hajimete) which means 'for the first time'. The importance score here is 3, which is lower than the first word but still useful. However, since it's a basic reading of the kanji and appears in many other words, I think it should be important as well.\n",
      "\n",
      "The third word is 初＊めて (はじめて, 4). This uses the same kanji and has a score of 4. It means 'for the first time' or 'just started'. This is also an important reading because it's widely used in various contexts. \n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, but I'm a bit confused. The user mentioned that some words are learned directly after the kanji if they're useful and represent important readings. So I need to prioritize words that teach key readings of the kanji. 初 has two main readings: はつ (hatsu) and はじ (hazi), which is part of 初＊め and 初＊めて.\n",
      "\n",
      "Since all three words use the same kanji, but each represents different readings, maybe I should pick one word that teaches the primary reading. However, 初めまして uses はつ, while 初＊め and 初＊めて use はじ. \n",
      "\n",
      "But considering their importance scores: 初めまして is a standalone phrase with high usage, so it's important. The other two are readings of the kanji. Since they have lower scores but still useful, maybe I should include them as well.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, no, perhaps I need to decide which words teach the most essential readings for the kanji. 初＊め (はじめ) is a basic noun meaning 'beginning' or 'start', so it's crucial for understanding the kanji. Similarly, 初＊めて (はじめて) is an adverb used frequently in sentences like 「初めて会う」(hajimekai, to meet for the first time). \n",
      "\n",
      "However, 初めまして itself isn't just a reading; it's a phrase that uses the same kanji but combines readings and particles. So maybe it's better to include the words that directly teach the readings of 初, which are はつ and はじ. Therefore, 初＊め (はじめ) and 初＊めて (はじめて) should be important because they represent the key readings, while 初めまして is a phrase that uses those readings but isn't just the reading itself.\n",
      "\n",
      "But wait, the user's instruction says to include words that are learned directly after the kanji if they're useful and represent important readings. So if I teach the phrases first, that might be more practical for learners. However, the user also mentions that at least one word should always be important to learn the most important reading.\n",
      "\n",
      "I think 初めまして is a high-frequency phrase and thus important, but it's not just a single reading. The other two are more about the readings of the kanji itself. So perhaps I should include both 初＊め (3) and 初＊めて (4) as important because they represent different readings, and 初めまして can be considered later.\n",
      "\n",
      "But wait, the importance scores might guide this: 5 is higher than 3 or 4. So maybe the highest score word should be included first. Alternatively, perhaps all three are important because each serves a purpose in learning the kanji's readings.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alternatively, considering that 初めまして uses the same kanji and is a high-frequency expression, it might be more practical to include it as an important word even if it's not just the reading. But the other two directly show the readings of 初, which is essential for understanding how the kanji is used.\n",
      "\n",
      "I'm a bit torn here. On one hand, teaching phrases can help with practical usage, but on the other hand, focusing on the kanji's readings is more about character acquisition. Since the task is to sort words containing certain kanji, I think it's better to prioritize the readings of the kanji itself.\n",
      "\n",
      "Therefore, 初＊め (はじめ) and 初＊めて (はじめて) should be considered important because they directly teach the readings of 初. Meanwhile, 初めまして can be learned later as a phrase that uses those readings but isn't just the reading itself.\n",
      "\n",
      "But looking back at the user's example response, they included only 初めまして and one other as important. Wait, in their example, they sorted 一番 (5) as important and others as not-important. So perhaps in this case, they considered the most important word as the one with the highest score, which is 初めまして.\n",
      "\n",
      "But I'm not sure if that's the right approach because 初＊め and 初＊めて are about the kanji's readings, while 初めまして is a phrase. The user's instruction says that for less important kanji, it's acceptable to have less important words, but at least one word should always be important to learn the most important reading.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, perhaps the highest score word (5) is 初めまして, which should be included as important because it teaches the phrase and uses the kanji. The other two are also important for their readings, so maybe all three are important, but that doesn't make sense because in the example only one was chosen.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, no, the user's example response had only one word in important and others in not-important. But I'm not sure if that's a rule or just an example.\n",

      "In any case, to follow the instructions strictly: \n",
      "\n",
      "- Important should include words that are useful and represent important readings.\n",
      "- 初めまして is a high-frequency phrase but doesn't directly teach the kanji's reading; it uses the kanji in a compound.\n",
      "- 初＊め and 初＊めて do directly teach the readings of 初, which are crucial for understanding the kanji.\n",
      "\n",
      "Given that, I think both 初＊め and 初＊れて should be considered important because they represent the key readings. However, if I have to choose based on importance scores, 5 is the highest, so maybe only 初めまして is important, but that doesn't make sense because it's a phrase.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alternatively, perhaps all three are important, but since the user wants them split into two lists, and in their example they had one in important and others in not-important, I think the correct approach is to include the highest score word as important and the rest as not-important. But that doesn't align with teaching the kanji's readings.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, perhaps I should consider which words are more about the kanji itself versus phrases. Since 初めまして is a phrase using the kanji but not just the reading, while the others directly show the readings. Therefore, 初＊め and 初＊めて are more important for learning the kanji's readings.\n",
      "\n",
      "But in their example response, they included only one word as important. Maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Perhaps any word with a score of 4 or above is considered important, while below is not. So, 初めまして (5) and 初＊めて (4) are important, while 初＊め (3) is not.\n",
      "\n",
      "But the user's example had only one in important. Hmm.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alternatively, perhaps all words with a score of 4 or above are considered important, so 初めまして (5) and 初＊れて (4) are important, while 初＊め (3) is not.\n",
      "\n",
      "Therefore, I think:\n",

      "\n",
      "Alternatively, perhaps only the highest score is considered important, and others are not. So only 初めまして (5) is important.\n",
      "\n",
      "I think that might be the case. Since the example response included only the highest score as important, perhaps the rule is to include the top scoring word(s) as important and the rest as not-important.\n",

      "\n",
      "First, we have 腹 (はら or おなか) with an importance score of 3. This is a common kanji meaning \"stomach.\" The readings are はら and おなか, but I know that おなか is more frequently used in everyday language, especially when talking about one's stomach feeling bad or being full. However, the main reading taught for 腹 is likely はら because it's the standard on'yomi.\n",
      "\n",
      "Next up is 腹がヘタ (はらがへた), also with a score of 3. This phrase means \"having a sore stomach\" or \"stomach ache.\" It uses the same kanji, 腹, but in a compound form. Since it's an important score of 3, it might be useful, but I'm not sure if it's essential to learn right after the kanji.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then there's 切腹 (せっぷく) with an importance score of 1. This term refers to \"seppuku,\" a ritual suicide by cutting the stomach in feudal Japan. It's a historical term and might be less commonly used today. Given the low importance score, it's probably better learned later.\n",
      "\n",
      "The goal is to assign words that are useful and represent important readings for each kanji to be learned immediately after the kanji. The other words can be studied later.\n",
      "\n",
      "Looking at 腹 first: its main reading is はら (as in おなか is a common word, but perhaps it's taught separately). However, since はら is part of 腹がヘタ, which might not be as crucial to learn right away, maybe that should be the one learned later. Alternatively, if はら is the primary reading, then learning 切腹 immediately might not make sense because its reading is せっぷく, a different on'yomi.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, but 腹's readings are both はら and おなか. So the important words should include those that teach the main readings. However, in this case, all three words use 腬 or腹? Wait no, 切腹 uses 切 (slice) and 腰 (hara). Oh wait, 切腹 is 切 (せつ/きる) + 腕 (そく), but no, I think it's 切 (ki/r-) + 腹 (hara). So the kanji for 切腹 are 切 and 腳. Wait, that can't be right. Let me check: 切腹 is \"seppuku,\" which is cutting the stomach, so the kanji are 切 (to cut) and 腕? No, actually, it's 切腹 where 切 is the cutting action and 腩 is the stomach. So the kanji for 切腹 is 切 and 腪. Wait, that doesn't make sense because I thought it was 切腹 with two characters: 切 and 腚? No, wait, no—it's actually one kanji: 切腹. No, that can’t be right. Wait, no—切腹 is a single compound kanji, but in reality, it's made of two separate kanji: 切 (to cut) and 腺 (stomach). So the word is written as two separate kanji: 切 and 腎.\n",
      "\n",
      "But wait, I think that might be incorrect. Let me clarify: 切腹 is actually a single compound kanji where it's written as one character? No, no—it's two kanji: 切 (slice) and 腉 (stomach). So the word uses both kanji.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, but in the initial list provided by the user, all words contain a certain kanji. But looking at the words given:\n",
      "\n",
      "- 腮 (is this a typo? Probably not; maybe it's 腕 or another kanji. Wait, no: The first word is 腰 (maybe) but the user wrote 腮, which I think might be a typo for 腸 or something else. Wait, let me look again.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, in the initial problem statement, the words are:\n",
      "\n",
      "- 腡 (はら or おなか, 3)\n",
      "- 腡がヘタ (はらがへた, 3)\n",
      "- 切腹 (せっぷく, 1)\n",
      "\n",
      "So all three words use the kanji 腣. Because \"腹\" is the kanji for stomach.\n",
      "\n",
      "Therefore, all three words share the same kanji: 腣.\n",
      "\n",
      "So when creating flashcards, we're focusing on 腣 and its readings.\n",
      "\n",
      "Given that, the important words to learn directly after the kanji should be those that represent the main readings. So 腣 is read as はら or おなか. Since はら is more formal and おなか is colloquial, perhaps both are important, but maybe はら is primary.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, in the list, we have:\n",
      "\n",
      "- 腡 (はら/おなか, 3)\n",
      "- 腡がヘタ (はらがへた, 3)\n",
      "- 切腹 (せっぷく,1)\n",
      "\n",
      "So all three share the same kanji: 腣.\n",
      "\n",
      "The important score is 3 for 腡 and its compound, and 1 for 切腹.\n",
      "\n",
      "Given that, I think the primary reading to learn first would be 腡 itself as はら or おなか. But in the list, it's given as \"腹 (はら/おなか,3)\" which is just the kanji with two readings. So when making flashcards, perhaps learning the word directly after the kanji should include either はら or おなか.\n",
      "\n",
      "But since both are important, but perhaps the single-kanji word 腡 (はら) is more essential than the compound words.\n",
      "\n",
      "So for the \"important\" list, I would choose 腡 as it's the base kanji and represents one of its readings. Then, perhaps also include 腡がヘタ since it uses はら again but with a meaning that might be useful, but maybe not necessary to learn immediately. Alternatively, since the importance score is same (3), I might choose to include both in important.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, but the user said that some words are learned directly after the kanji, and others later. The ones learned directly should only be the useful and important readings. So for 腡, the main readings are はら and おなか, so perhaps including the word 腡 itself as an important word.\n",
      "\n",
      "But in the list provided by the user, the words to choose from are:\n",
      "\n",
      "- 腡 (はら/おなか,3)\n",
      "- 腄がヘタ (はらがへた,3)\n",
      "- 切腹 (せっぷく,1)\n",
      "\n",
      "So all three have the same kanji, but different usages.\n",
      "\n",
      "Given that, I think the most important word to learn after the kanji is 腡 itself because it's the base. The other words are compounds that use the same kanji but in different contexts.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, since the user provided these specific words, perhaps they want the primary word (the kanji itself) to be considered as an important word, and the others as not-important.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, but the problem says: \"Some of the words are going to be learned directly after the kanji, and others are going to be learned later. The words that are learned directly after the kanji should only be words that are useful and words that represent important readings.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "So, for each kanji (here it's 腡), we need to pick which of its words are important to learn right away.\n",
      "\n",
      "In this case, since all three words use 腄, but they're different words. So perhaps the single-kanji word is more fundamental, so \"腹\" itself would be learned first. But in the list, the first entry is the kanji with readings, and then two compound words.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, no—the list provided by the user includes three separate words, each containing the same kanji (I think). So for example:\n",
      "\n",
      "- 腡 is the kanji plus its readings\n",
      "- 腄がヘタ is another word using 腄\n",
      "- 切腹 is a third word using 腄\n",
      "\n",
      "So as an initial step, after learning the kanji 腄 and its basic readings (はら, おなか), the next words to learn would be compound words that use 腄. But among these three, which are more important.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"腹\" itself is essential because it's a standalone word meaning stomach. \"腹がヘタ\" would mean something like \"has a bad stomach\" or \"sick to one's stomach.\" And \"切腹\" is a specific term for ritual suicide by disembowelment (seppuku).\n",
      "\n",
      "Given that, I think the single-kanji word 腡 is most essential, then perhaps 切腹 as it's a culturally significant term. But since the importance scores are 3 and 1, maybe prioritizing based on score.\n",
      "\n",
      "But wait, in the list given by the user:\n",
      "\n",
      "- 腄 (はら/おなか,3)\n",
      "- 腄がヘタ (はらがへた,3)\n",
      "- 切腹 (せっぷく,1)\n",
      "\n",
      "So \"腹\" is a word with two readings and an importance score of 3.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then, \"腹がヘタ\" also has the same kanji but in a compound, and it's also scored 3.\n",
      "\n",
      "And \"切腹\" is another word using 腄, but with a different reading (せっぷく) and scored 1.\n",
      "\n",
      "So perhaps the important words to learn directly are those that represent the main readings or are more common. In this case, both \"腹\" itself and \"腹がヘタ\" might be considered important because they use the kanji in different contexts. But I'm not sure if \"腹\" is a word on its own—yes, it's a noun meaning stomach.\n",
      "\n",
      "But looking back at the problem statement: the user provided three words containing the same kanji (I think) and wants to decide which are learned directly after the kanji. So perhaps for each kanji, we should select one or two words that represent important readings.\n",
      "\n",
      "Given that \"腹\" itself is a standalone word with reading はら/おなか, it's essential. Then, other compounds using 腄 might be considered later.\n",
      "\n",
      "But in the given list, all three are separate words. So perhaps the most important ones to learn first are \"腹\" (the single-kanji word) and \"切腹,\" which is a significant term. But since \"腹がヘタ\" is another compound with the same kanji but lower importance? Or not.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, no—the scores for 腄 and 腄がヘタ are both 3, while 切腹 is 1.\n",
      "\n",
      "So perhaps all three have high or medium importance, but it's about which ones to learn first.\n",
      "\n",
      "Given that, I think the primary word \"腹\" itself should be in the important list, along with perhaps another common compound like 腄がヘタ. But since both have the same score (3), maybe include both as important. Alternatively, prioritize single-kanji words before compounds.\n",
      "\n",
      "But given the problem statement says that some words are learned directly after the kanji, which I assume refers to words that use only that kanji without others—so perhaps \"腹\" itself is the direct word, and then the other two are compound words learned later.\n",
      "\n",
      "Therefore, in this case, I would put 腄 (the single-kanji word) as important, and the others as not important for immediate learning.\n",

So the focus is on which words are essential enough that they should be learned right away with the kanji.\n",
      "\n",
      "So considering that, \"腹\" itself is definitely an important word because it's the standalone noun for stomach. It's a fundamental term. The compound 腄がヘタ might also be useful, but perhaps not as critical as knowing the basic meaning of the kanji. On the other hand, 切腹 is a specific cultural term and probably less common in daily conversation.\n",

      "Therefore, I would categorize \"腹\" (the single-kanji word) and maybe \"切腹\" into the important list because they are significant, while \"腹がヘタ\" could be learned later. But since both 腄 and 腄がヘタ have the same score of 3, perhaps include both as important.\n",
      "\n",
      "But to clarify, usually when learning kanji, you start with the single character and its basic meanings before moving on to compounds.

      "1. 入籍 (にゅうせき) – This means \"residency\" or \"nationality\" in Japanese. It's composed of the kanji 入 and 籍. Both kanji are fairly common, but I'm not sure about their individual importance scores. However, since the overall word has a score of 0, which is low, it might be considered less important for initial learning.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. 国籍 (こくせき) – This also means \"nationality\" and is made up of 国 and 着 or 籍? Wait, no, actually, 籍 is the same as in 入籍. So both words share the same kanji: 籍. That's interesting.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, let me check the kanji again. 入籍 uses 入 (entry) and 籍 (books, register). 国籍 uses 国 (country) and 着? No, actually, 国籍 is 国 (country) + 着? Wait no, I think I'm mixing up characters. Let me confirm: 国籍 is 国 (country) plus 着 (to wear)? No, that doesn't make sense. Oh wait, maybe it's 籍 again. Hmm, perhaps the second character in 国籍 is 着 or something else. Wait no, I think 国籍 is 国 (country) + 着 – but that would mean \"country wearing,\" which doesn't make sense. Maybe I'm mistaken here.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, no, actually, 国籍 is 国 (country) plus 着 as in the verb to wear? That seems off. Alternatively, maybe it's another kanji. Wait, perhaps it's 着 as in the same as 籍 but with a different reading. No, that doesn't make sense either.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, I think I'm getting confused here. Let me clarify: 入籍 is 入 (nyū) + 籍 (seki), and 国籍 is 国 (koku) + 着 (seki). So both have the same second kanji, but different first ones. The readings are にゅうせき for 入籍 and こくせき for 国籍.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, considering the importance scores: both words have a score of 0, which is quite low. But I need to decide if either of them should be considered important enough to learn right after their kanji.\n",
      "\n",
      "The user mentioned that at least one word should always be important to learn the most important reading of the kanji. So looking at the shared kanji, 籍 appears in both words. If we're focusing on learning the readings for 籍, then both 入籍 and 国籍 would help with that.\n",
      "\n",
      "But since both have a score of 0, maybe neither is considered very important. However, the task says to sort them into important and not-important lists. Since their scores are low but they do share kanji, perhaps one should be selected as important.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, no, the importance score for each word is 0, so both might fall under not-important. But then, there's a note that at least one word should be important to learn the most important reading of the kanji. So maybe I need to pick one as important even if their overall score is low because they represent an important reading.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alternatively, perhaps neither is considered important enough, but since both share the same kanji (籍), maybe one needs to be marked as important for that kanji's reading.\n",
      "\n",
      "Hmm, this is a bit confusing. Let me try to structure it:\n",
      "\n",
      "- Both words have a score of 0, which suggests they're not very important.\n",
      "- They share the kanji 籍, so learning either would help with that kanji's reading.\n",
      "- The user's instruction says that at least one word should be important to learn the most important reading. So perhaps one of them is considered important for that reason.\n",
      "\n",
      "Since both words are similar and have low scores, maybe it's better to mark one as important and the other as not-important. But I'm not sure which one would be more useful.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alternatively, if neither is very important, but they share the same kanji, perhaps both should be marked as not-important, but that might leave a gap in learning the readings for 籍. So maybe one has to be chosen.\n",
      "\n",
      "But looking back at the examples given by the user in their initial message, they provided 一番 (いちばん,5) and another word with an asterisk, which I assume was more important. In this case, since both words have a score of 0, perhaps neither is considered important, but to fulfill the requirement that at least one should be important for the kanji's reading, maybe one needs to be selected.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, the user said \"All words may be classified as important. But for less important kanji it is acceptable to have less important words.\" So if the kanji is less important, then the words can also be less important. However, at least one word should represent the most important reading.\n",

Maybe that's handled separately.\n",

      "Looking at the example response they provided, I see that \"一番 (いちばん, 5)\" was placed in the important list. Since it's scored a 5, which is the highest, it definitely belongs there.

Their deep need is likely to structure their learning effectively without overwhelming themselves, ensuring that foundational knowledge is mastered before moving on.\n",

      "First, let me look at each word individually:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. お見舞い (おみまい, 1)\n",
      "   - The reading is \"omimai\". This word means something like condolences or visiting someone who's ill. I think it's a useful word in daily conversation. The importance score here is 1, which is on the lower end, but since it's directly tied to the kanji 見 and 斐 (but wait, no, 舞 is another kanji), actually, お見舞い has two kanji: 見 and 舞. Hmm, maybe I should check each word for their kanji.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, actually, looking at the words:\n",
      "\n",
      "- お見舞い uses 見 (see) and 舞 (dance). So the kanji here are 見 and 舞.\n",
      "- 歌舞伎 is \"kabuki\", which uses 歌 (sing), 舞 (dance), and 伎 (art/technique). So three kanji: 歌, 舞, 伎.\n",
      "- 舞台 is \"butai\" meaning stage. The kanji here are 舞 and 台.\n",
      "- 舞＊う is \"mau\", which I think might be a less common reading for 舞.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, maybe the words provided are all related to the kanji 舞? Let me check:\n",
      "\n",
      "- お見舞い includes 舞\n",
      "- 歌舞伎 includes 舞\n",
      "- 舞台 includes 舞\n",
      "- 舞＊う is just 般, but written with a star maybe indicating an alternative form or something.\n",
      "\n",
      "So perhaps the main kanji here is 舞. But each word also has other kanji. So I need to consider which words best represent important readings for their respective kanji.\n",
      "\n",
      "Let me list out each word and its importance:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. お見舞い (重要度: 1)\n",
      "2. 歌舞伎 (重要度: 2)\n",
      "3. 舞台 (重要度: 2)\n",
      "4. 舞＊う (重要度: 1)\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, for the kanji in each word:\n",
      "\n",
      "- お見舞い: 見 and 舞\n",
      "   - 跳舞 is a common word with 舞, but おみまい is also quite useful.\n",
      "   \n",
      "- 歌舞伎: 歌, 舞, 伎. This refers to Kabuki theater, which is culturally significant. The reading \"kabuki\" is important for the kanji combination.\n",
      "\n",
      "- 舞台: 舞 and 台. This means stage, used in both performing arts and literally (like a platform). It's a common word.\n",
      "\n",
      "- 舞＊う: I'm not sure about this one. The star might indicate an alternative form or perhaps it's a less common reading for 般. Maybe it's \"mau\" as a verb meaning to dance? Not sure how common that is.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, the task is to assign words as important if they are useful and represent important readings of their kanji. If not, they should be learned later.\n",
      "\n",
      "Starting with お見舞い: It's an important expression in Japanese for offering condolences. So it's definitely a high-use word. Even though its score is 1, I think it's still important because it's practical. So it should go into the important list.\n",
      "\n",
      "歌舞伎: Kabuki theater is culturally significant, and knowing this word can help with understanding literature or cultural references. The reading \"kabuki\" itself is tied to these kanji, so learning this word early could be beneficial. Score is 2, which is higher than 1, so it should be important.\n",
      "\n",
      "舞台: This is a very common word used in both arts and literal contexts (like a platform). It's widely used, so it's definitely important. The score is also 2, so it goes into the important list.\n",
      "\n",
      "舞＊う: I'm not as familiar with this one. Maybe it's an archaic or less common form of the verb to dance? Since its score is only 1 and it doesn't seem as essential as the others, it might be better learned later after the more important words are mastered. So it should go into the not-important list.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, but all four words have different kanji, so perhaps each word corresponds to a specific kanji's reading. Let me think again.\n",
      "\n",
      "Actually, the user said that some words will be learned directly after the kanji if they're useful and represent important readings. So for each kanji in the words provided, we need to pick at least one word that teaches an important reading of that kanji.\n",
      "\n",
      "Looking at the kanji involved:\n",
      "\n",
      "- 舞 appears in お見舞い, 歌舞伎, 舞台, and 舞＊う.\n",
      "- 見 is in お見舞い.\n",
      "- 台 is in 舞台.\n",
      "- 歌 is in 歌舞伎.\n",
      "- 伎 is in 歌舞伎.\n",
      "\n",
      "For each kanji:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. 舞: important words would be those that teach key readings. The most common reading for 興 is \"mai\" (as in 舞踊, mayou). お見舞い uses \"ma\" as part of the compound, but perhaps not the main reading. 歌舞伎 also has \"mai\". 舞台 uses \"bu\", which might be a less common or different reading? Wait, no—舞台 is \"butai\", so the reading for 舞 here is \"bu\"? That doesn't seem right because usually, 舞 is \"ma\" in most words. Maybe it's a different kanji?\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me clarify:\n",
      "\n",
      "- お見舞い: 見 (see) and 舞 (dance). So the readings are \"omi\" for おみまい.\n",
      "- 歌舞伎: 歌 (kai?), 舞 (mai?), 伎 (ki?). Wait, no—the reading is \"kabuki\", which is a combination of these kanji. So perhaps each part contributes to that sound.\n",
      "- 舞台: 舞 (ma) and 台 (dai), so \"butai\" would be the reading? Or maybe it's \"ba-ti\"? No, I think it's \"butsuide\".\n",
      "Wait, no—舞台 is pronounced \"butai\". So for 舞 in 舞台, the reading is \"bu\", which might not be as common as \"ma\".\n",
      "\n",
      "So perhaps お見舞い and 歌舞伎 are more important because they use \"ma\" for 舞, which is a standard reading. 舞台 uses \"bu\", which may be less common or an alternative reading.\n",
      "\n",
      "Therefore, the important words would be those that teach the primary readings of their kanji. So お見舞い and 歌舞伎 are better because they use more common readings for 舞, while 舞台 might use a less common reading, making it perhaps not as crucial to learn first. However, 舞台 is still a very useful word in modern Japanese, so maybe that's an exception.\n",
      "\n",
      "But considering the instructions: \"the words that are learned directly after the kanji should only be words that are useful and words that represent important readings.\" So for each kanji, we pick words that teach their main readings. If a word doesn't do that, it goes to not-important.\n",
      "\n",
      "So:\n",
      "\n",
      "- For 舞, お見舞い uses \"ma\" as part of the compound (omi), but I'm not sure if it's teaching the main reading \"mai\". 歌舞伎 also includes \"ma\", while 舞台 has \"bu\", which might be less common. So perhaps お见舞い is better for teaching \"ma\".\n",
      "\n",
      "- For 見, only in お见舞い. So that word is important for 見's reading.\n",
      "\n",
      "- For 台, only in 舞台, so if we consider the main reading, maybe it's not as essential unless \"dai\" is more common elsewhere.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, but 台 can be pronounced \"tai\", like in 高校 (koukou) where it's part of the word. So perhaps in 舞台, it's \"da\". Hmm.\n",
      "\n",
      "This is getting confusing. Maybe I should approach this differently.\n",
      "\n",
      "The user wants to categorize each provided word as important or not based on whether they are useful and represent important readings for their kanji.\n",
      "\n",
      "Given that:\n",
      "\n",
      "- お见舞い: Useful, teaches \"omi\" for 見 and \"ma\" for 舞.\n",
      "- 歌舞伎: Cultural significance, teaches \"kabuki\" but may be less immediately useful.\n",
      "- 舞台: Common word, practical in modern usage.\n",
      "- 舞＊う: Possibly archaic or less common.\n",
      "\n",
      "Since all three except perhaps 舞＊う are useful and represent important readings for their kanji, they should go into the important list. 舞＊う might be better learned later, so it's not-important.\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "Important:\n",
      "1. お见舞い\n",
      "2. 歌舞伎\n",
      "3. 舞台\n",

      "Not-Important:\n",
      "4. 舞＊う\n",
      "\n",
      "But the user only provided four words: お見舞い、歌舞伎、舞台、舞＊う。 Wait, no—the initial list seems to include these four.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, actually, looking back:\n",
      "\n",
      "The user wrote:\n",

      "But then the content is a different matter—perhaps they are referring to words rather than sentences? Or maybe it's about categorizing the provided words into important and not.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, perhaps the four items listed are the ones that need to be categorized: お见舞い、歌舞伎、舞台、舞＊う.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, based on analysis:\n",
      "\n",
      "- お見舞い is useful and represents important readings for 見 and 舞. So important.\n",
      "- 歌舞伎 is useful culturally and teaches important readings for its kanji. Important.\n",
      "- 舞台 is a common word with practical use. Important.\n",
      "- 舞＊う seems less essential, perhaps an archaic or less used form. Not-important.\n",
      "\n",
      "Thus, the not-important category only includes 舞＊う.\n",
      "\n",
      "But the initial instruction said: \"if you are going to teach me Japanese, i want you to first categorize all the sentences into important and not important based on whether they are useful and represent important readings for their kanji.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, but in the content provided by the user, they just pasted a text about Japanese language study. Maybe I misread.\n",
      "\n",
      "Actually, perhaps the user hasn't provided specific sentences or words yet; they're outlining their request. So when they do provide the sentences, I'll need to categorize them as important or not based on utility and relevance to kanji readings.\n",
      "\n",
      "But in the absence of specific data, maybe I should proceed with an example.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alternatively, perhaps the user is referring to the list of vocabulary they provided elsewhere, but it's unclear.\n",
      "\n",
      "In any case, my approach would be:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. For each sentence/word provided, assess its utility and whether it teaches important readings for the kanji involved.\n",
      "2. Categorize accordingly into important or not.\n",
      "\n",
      "Given that, if I were to categorize お见舞い、歌舞伎、舞台、舞＊う:\n",
      "\n",
      "- 重要 (Important): お见舞い、歌舞伎、舞台\n",
      "- 不要 (Not-important): 舞＊う\n",
      "\n",
      "This way, the user can prioritize learning the more essential words first and tackle the less common one later.\n",
      "\n",
      "Additionally, I would consider providing translations or additional context for each word to aid in understanding why they are categorized as such. For example:\n",
      "\n",
      "- お見舞い: \"condolences\" – very useful in social contexts.\n",
      "- 歌舞伎: \"Kabuki theater\" – important culturally but perhaps less immediately practical unless interested in arts.\n",
      "- 舞台: \"stage\" – commonly used in both artistic and non-artistic contexts.\n",
      "- 舞＊う: Less common, possibly archaic or dialectical.\n",
      "\n",
      "Therefore, the user can focus on the first three for initial learning and handle the fourth later if needed.\n",

My job is to decide which ones should be learned immediately after the kanji and which ones can be learned later.\n",

      "1. 身 (み, 3)\n",
      "2. 身元 (みもと, 3)\n",
      "3. 身分 (みぶん, 1)\n",
      "4. 中身 (なかみ, 1)\n",
      "\n",
      "Each of these has a kanji and a reading along with an importance score from 0 to 5. The user mentioned that words learned directly after the kanji should only be those that are useful and represent important readings. If a word isn't useful or doesn't have an important reading, it should be learned later.\n",
      "\n",
      "I need to decide which of these four words fall into the 'Important' category and which into 'Not-important'. The user also specified that at least one word should always be important for the most important reading of the kanji.\n",
      "\n",
      "Let me break down each word:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. 身 (み, 3): This is a single kanji meaning \"body\" or \"person.\" It's pretty common and appears in many compound words. The importance score here is 3, which isn't too high but still significant.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. 身元 (みもと, 3): This word means \"origin\" or \"source,\" often used to refer to someone's background or the origin of something. It uses the same '身' kanji as above and has a similar importance score.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. 身分 (みぶん, 1): This is another compound with '身,' meaning \"status\" or \"position.\" The score here is lower at 1, which might indicate it's less critical.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. 中身 (なかみ, 1): Using the kanji '中' meaning \"inside,\" this word refers to \"contents\" or \"substance.\" Its importance score is also 1.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, I need to consider which of these should be learned immediately after their respective kanji. The key point is that the words chosen for immediate learning should represent important readings of the kanji.\n",
      "\n",
      "Looking at '身' (み), it's a fundamental kanji. Learning 身 itself would help in understanding its basic meaning and pronunciation, so that seems important to learn right away. However, according to the user's instruction, if the word isn't useful or doesn't have an important reading, it should be learned later.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, but '身' as a single kanji is quite essential, so maybe it's better to include it in the important list despite its score being 3. The other words using '身' are compounds with higher scores: 身元 (3) and 身分 (1). But since the instruction says that if a word isn't useful or doesn't represent an important reading, it should be learned later.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alternatively, perhaps the user wants to prioritize words that teach the most common readings. Since '身' itself is a basic reading, maybe it's more crucial than its compound forms. However, in this case, all the words provided except 中身 use the '身' kanji, and 中身 uses '中.'\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, I need to clarify: each word has a certain kanji, but some are single kanji (like 身) while others are compounds (身元, 身分, 中身). The user wants me to sort all the words into important or not, based on whether they're useful and represent important readings for their respective kanji.\n",
      "\n",
      "So for each word:\n",
      "\n",
      "- 身: As a single kanji, it's fundamental. Learning this directly would help with understanding its basic meaning and reading. So it should be in the Important list.\n",
      "- 身元: Uses '身' (body) + '元' (origin). It's a useful word but perhaps not as essential as learning '身' itself first. Its score is 3, so maybe important.\n",
      "- 身分: Also uses '身,' meaning status. But its score is lower at 1, so less important.\n",
      "- 中身: Uses '中' (inside) and has a score of 1. Since the kanji here is '中,' which means inside, but the word itself refers to contents. It's not as common as other readings.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, perhaps I should look at each kanji separately. The words provided have two different kanji: 身 and 中. So for the kanji 身, we have three words: 身 (score 3), 身元 (3), and 身分 (1). For the kanji 中, we have 中身 (1).\n",
      "\n",
      "The user's instruction says that at least one word should be important to learn the most important reading of the word. So for each kanji, I need to ensure that at least one word is considered important.\n",
      "\n",
      "For '身,' its most important reading is likely \"mi,\" as in 身. The words using this kanji are:\n",
      "\n",
      "- 身 (み): Important.\n",
      "- 身元 (みもと): Also uses み and adds 元, which might be a less common suffix.\n",
      "- 身分 (みぶん): Uses み but with a different ending.\n",
      "\n",
      "So perhaps the single '身' is more important to learn first. However, since the user wants words that are learned directly after the kanji, I'm not sure if they mean that each word's own kanji or the kanji within the word.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, maybe I need to clarify: The task is to sort all the provided words into Important and Not-important lists based on their utility and importance of their readings for their respective kanji.\n",
      "\n",
      "Each word has a certain kanji. So:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. 身 (kanji: 身): This is a single kanji with reading み.\n",
      "2. 身元 (kanji: 身 元): Both '身' and '元.'\n",
      "3. 身分 (kanji: 身 分)\n",
      "4. 中身 (kanji: 中 身)\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, that complicates things because each word may have multiple kanji.\n",
      "\n",
      "But the user's instruction says \"All words contain a certain kanji.\" So perhaps each word is associated with one main kanji? Or maybe it's about all the kanji in the word. This is a bit unclear.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alternatively, perhaps for each word, we consider its kanji(s) and whether learning that word would teach an important reading of those kanji.\n",
      "\n",
      "So let me approach this:\n",
      "\n",
      "For the word 身 (み), the kanji is 身. It's a single kanji with reading み, score 3. Important to learn as it teaches the basic reading and meaning of 身.\n",
      "\n",
      "身元 (みもと): This word includes 身 and 元. The main focus here might be on '身,' but since it's part of a compound, perhaps learning this later is okay if another word better represents the important reading for 身.\n",
      "\n",
      "身分 (みぶん): Again, uses 身, but with 分. Similar logic as above.\n",
      "\n",
      "中身 (なかみ): Uses 中 and 身. Here, '中' might be the primary kanji to focus on, so this word would teach なか as a reading of 中.\n",
      "\n",
      "But wait, in 中身, '中' is read as なか and '身' as み. So for the kanji 中, the important reading is なか (as in 中身), which is score 1. But that's low.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, perhaps we should prioritize words where their readings are more common or higher importance. So:\n",
      "\n",
      "- 身: Important because it teaches the basic み reading.\n",
      "- 身元: Also uses み and 元, but since 身 is already covered by the single kanji word, maybe this can be learned later.\n",
      "- 身分: Similarly, since 身's main reading is covered, perhaps this can be not important.\n",
      "- 中身: As it teaches the なか reading of 中, which might be less common, so perhaps it's less important.\n",
      "\n",
      "But wait, another perspective: Maybe each word should be evaluated based on whether its own kanji(s) have an important reading that needs to be learned. So:\n",
      "\n",
      "For 身 (kanji: 身):\n",
      "\n",
      "- Reading み is crucial for 身. The word 身 itself teaches this.\n",
      "- 身元 and 身分 also use み but in compounds, which may not be as essential as the single kanji.\n",
      "\n",
      "Therefore, perhaps only 身 should be considered important because it's the base form, while the others can be learned later.\n",
      "\n",
      "For 中身 (kanji: 中 and 身):\n",
      "\n",
      "- '中' is read as なか, which might be a less common or less critical reading compared to other readings like ちゅう.\n",
      "- '身' is already covered by the word 身 itself.\n",
      "\n",
      "So for 中身, maybe it's not as important because:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. The main kanji (中) has another more common reading (ちゅう) which isn't covered here.\n",
      "2. The reading of 中身 (なかみ) might be less critical.\n",
      "\n",
      "But without knowing all possible readings and their priorities, perhaps the scores can guide us: 身 is 3, others are lower or same.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alternatively, maybe we should consider each word's score as an indicator of its importance. So:\n",
      "\n",
      "- 身: score 3 → Important.\n",
      "- 身元: score 3 → Important.\n",
      "- 身分: score 1 → Not important.\n",
      "- 中身: score 1 → Not important.\n",
      "\n",
      "But that might not align with the instruction, which says to consider whether the word teaches an important reading of its kanji. So even if a word has a high score, it might not be as crucial if another word better serves the same purpose.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alternatively, perhaps all words are evaluated individually based on their utility and importance in teaching their kanji's readings.\n",
      "\n",
      "In that case:\n",
      "\n",
      "- 身: As a single kanji, it's fundamental. Important.\n",
      "- 身元: While useful, perhaps less critical than the base form. Maybe not important.\n",
      "- 身分: Similarly, maybe not as important.\n",
      "- 中身: Since it teaches なか (a reading of 中), but if another word better covers that kanji's more common readings, this might be not important.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, but '中' is often read as ちゅう in words like 中途 (ちゅうとは). So maybe the reading なか is less common. Therefore, 中身 may not be as crucial for teaching '中.'\n",
      "\n",
      "So putting it all together:\n",
      "\n",
      "Important list: 身 (kanji 身, basic and high score)\n",
      "Not important: 身元, 身分, 中身.\n",
      "\n",
      "But wait, another angle: Maybe each kanji needs to have at least one word that teaches its most important reading. So for '中,' the most important reading is ちゅう, not なか (as in 中途). Therefore, 中身's reading なか might be a less common or secondary reading, so maybe it's not as crucial.\n",
      "\n",
      "Thus:\n",
      "\n",
      "- For 身: The word 身 itself teaches み, which is essential.\n",
      "- For 元: Not covered by any other words except 身元. But since the focus is on each word's kanji, perhaps '元' isn't a primary kanji here.\n",
      "- For 分: Covered in 身分 but not critical for learning 身.\n",
      "- For 中: The main reading is ちゅう, so 中身 doesn't teach that.\n",
      "\n",
      "Therefore, only 身 is important because it teaches the essential reading of its kanji. All others are less important or can be learned later.\n",
      "\n",
      "But I'm not entirely sure about this. It might depend on specific educational priorities or curriculum guidelines.\n",
      "</think>\n",
      "\n",
      "Based on the analysis, the word \"身\" (み) is considered the most important as it teaches the fundamental reading and meaning of the kanji 身. The other words (\"身元,\" \"身分,\" and \"中身\") are deemed less critical because they either build upon the base form or introduce less common readings.\n",

      "First up is 謝る (あやまる, 4). The reading is 'ayamaru', which means to apologize or ask pardon. The score is 4 out of 5, so that's quite high. Since it's a common verb and important for communication, I should categorize this as Important.\n",

      "\n",
      "Lastly, 笑*う (わらう, 2) meaning to laugh. This is very basic and essential for daily use, so even though the score is lower at 2, it should still be Important because knowing this verb is fundamental.\n",

      "Alright, I need to help sort these Japanese words into important and not-important categories based on their readings and importance scores. Let's break down each word step by step.\n",
      "\n",
      "First, let me look at the list provided:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. 他 (ほか, 4)\n",
      "2. その他 (そのほか, 4)\n",
      "3. 他人 (たにん, 3)\n",
      "\n",
      "Each of these has a kanji or combination, their readings, and an importance score from 0 to 5.\n",
      "\n",
      "Starting with 他 (ほか). This is a single kanji that means \"other\" or \"another.\" It's quite common in Japanese, used in many expressions like 他人 (tairen) which I'll get to later. The importance score here is 4, so it's pretty high. Since it's a standalone kanji, it should be learned early because knowing this kanji can help with understanding other words that use it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Next, その他 (そのほか). This word means \"other\" or \"else.\" It’s also quite common and appears in various contexts, like その他皆様 (sono tara kyōjō), which is a polite way to address others. The score here is 4 as well. Since this is a compound of the kanji 他 with another character, it might be better to learn it later after mastering the individual kanji first. But since both words have high scores, I need to consider whether they should be important or not.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, 他人 (たにん). This means \"other person\" or \"stranger.\" It's a useful word in daily conversation and appears frequently in texts. The importance score is 3, which is still decent but lower than the others. However, it's a compound of the same 他 kanji we discussed earlier, so learning this could reinforce knowledge of 他.\n",
      "\n",
      "The task is to separate these into important and not-important lists. Important should include words that are useful and represent important readings. Since all have relatively high scores, but perhaps some can be considered more foundational than others.\n",
      "\n",
      "Looking at the kanji 他, it's a standalone character with multiple readings (heya as well). Knowing this kanji is crucial because it appears in many other words like 他人 and その他. So, learning 他 early makes sense to grasp its fundamental meaning.\n",
      "\n",
      "The word 他人 uses the same 他 kanji but pairs it with 人 (hito). Since 他人 is a common word and the score is 3, it's still important but maybe not as critical as learning the standalone kanji first. So perhaps 他人 should be learned later to reinforce the 他 kanji after it's been introduced.\n",
      "\n",
      "Lastly, その他 combines 他 with その (sono). Since その is a common prefix and this word is also frequently used, it might make sense to learn it once both 他 and その are known. However, since its score is high, I need to decide if it should be in the important list or not.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, but according to the instructions, words that represent important readings of the kanji should be learned directly after the kanji. So if 他 has a reading ほか (4), which is a key reading, and it's used in both 他 and その他, perhaps we should prioritize 他 first because it teaches the base reading.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then, since 他人 uses the same 他 but with a different meaning, it might be useful to learn it early as well. However, its score is lower (3), so maybe it can go into not-important or be considered later.\n",
      "\n",
      "But the instructions say that at least one word should always be important for the most important reading of the kanji. So 他 has an importance of 4 and is a standalone kanji with a key reading, making it essential to include in the important list.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, looking at その他 (4) and 他人 (3), both use the 他 kanji but are compounds. Since their scores are high, they might still be considered important because they represent different readings or usages of the same kanji.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, no—the instructions say that words learned directly after the kanji should only be those that are useful and represent important readings. So perhaps 他 (ほか) is the primary one to learn first because it's the core reading. Then, maybe include 他人 as well since it's another common word, even if its score is lower.\n",
      "\n",
      "But wait, let me think again. The user wants words sorted into Important and Not-important lists based on whether they should be learned directly after the kanji or later.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, for each kanji, we need to select the most important readings early on. 他 has two readings: ほか (4) and another reading I'm not sure about—maybe ひと? Wait, no, 他 is usually just ほか. So 他 itself is important with a score of 4.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then, when creating flashcards, after learning the kanji 他, we might want to learn words that use this kanji to reinforce it. However, if those words are not as critical or have lower importance scores, they can be learned later.\n",
      "\n",
      "So in this case:\n",
      "\n",
      "- 他 (ほか,4) is a standalone kanji with high importance, so it should definitely be in Important.\n",
      "- 他人 (たにん,3) uses the same kanji but has a different reading. Since its score is 3, which is still decent but not as high as 4, maybe it can go into Not-important if we decide to prioritize higher scores first.\n",
      "\n",
      "But the instructions say that at least one word should be important for the most important reading of the word. Wait, perhaps I misread. The user said: \"the words that are learned directly after the kanji should only be words that are useful and represent important readings.\" So if a word doesn't represent an important reading or isn't useful, it's learned later.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, 他 (ほか) is important because it's standalone and has a high score. Then, 他人 uses 他 but with a different reading? Wait no— 他人 is read as たにん, which uses the same 他 kanji but combines it with 人 to make a new word.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, actually, 他人 is written as 他 + 人 (hito), so it's a compound. The reading for 他人 is たにん, which isn't directly related to the ほか reading of 他. So perhaps learning 他人 after 他 would help reinforce the kanji but may not be necessary if we're focusing on important readings.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alternatively, since 他人 is a common word and has an importance score of 3, it might still be useful enough to include in Important.\n",
      "\n",
      "On the other hand, その他 (そのほか) uses 他 with another character. The reading here is その+ほか, which is similar to 他's primary reading but prefixed. Since its score is also 4, it's quite important and perhaps should be included in Important as well.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, but I have only three words to sort. Let me list them again:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. 他 (ほか,4)\n",
      "2. その他 (そのほか,4)\n",
      "3. 他人 (たにん,3)\n",
      "\n",
      "I need to decide which are important and which aren't. Since all three have high scores, perhaps all should be considered important. But according to the instructions, some may be learned later if they don't represent important readings.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, but the task is to sort them into Important and Not-important lists. The user provided a format where I list the kanji of each word in either Important or Not-important.\n",
      "\n",
      "Given that 他 has a high score (4) and is standalone, it should definitely be in Important. Both その他 and 他人 also have scores above 3, which is not bad. However, perhaps since they are compounds, they can be learned later after the individual kanji is known.\n",
      "\n",
      "But wait, in the user's example response, he included 他、彼、己、 etc., but I don't know if that applies here. Let me try to make a decision.\n",
      "\n",
      "Given the scores and their structure:\n",
      "\n",
      "- 他 (4): standalone, important.\n",
      "- その他 (4): compound using 他, also high score.\n",
      "- 他人 (3): compound with a slightly lower score.\n",
      "\n",
      "I think all three should be considered Important because they each have high or decent importance. But since I need to sort them into two lists, perhaps only the most critical are in Important and the rest go to Not-important.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alternatively, if all of them are important, then put them all in Important. The user's example response included several words, so maybe it's acceptable for all to be in Important.\n",
      "\n",
      "But let me think again: 他 is a standalone kanji with high importance (4), so definitely in Important. Then, その他 uses the same kanji but adds another character; since its score is also 4, perhaps it should be included as well because it's useful and represents an important reading. Similarly, 他人 has a score of 3, which is still decent, so maybe include that too.\n",
      "\n",
      "But I have to make sure: are there any words among them that shouldn't be learned directly after the kanji? If a word isn't useful or doesn't represent an important reading, it should go to Not-important. However, all three seem useful and have high scores, so perhaps they all go into Important.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alternatively, maybe 他人 can be considered for later learning because its score is lower than the others. But I'm not sure; it's still a 3, which isn't too low.\n",
      "\n",
      "In conclusion, since all three words have relatively high importance scores (4 and 3), and none are clearly less useful, perhaps they should all be included in Important. Alternatively, if we need to split them, maybe only the standalone kanji goes into Important, but that seems unlikely because compounds can also be important.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, perhaps I misread the instructions. The user said: \"I am going to create flashcards for these words.\" So he's creating flashcards and wants to sort them based on whether they should be learned early (Important) or later (Not-important). Therefore, higher importance scores suggest they should be learned earlier.\n",
      "\n",
      "Given that 他 is standalone with a score of 4, it should definitely be in Important. Both その他 and 他人 have high scores (4 and 3), so they also belong to Important.\n",

      "Alright, I need to help this user sort a list of Japanese words into two categories: Important and Not-important. The task is to determine which words should be learned directly after the kanji based on their usefulness and importance.\n",
      "\n",
      "First, let me look at the words provided. There are two words: 子宮 (しきゅう, 0) and 宮 (みや, 2). Each has a kanji with its own readings and an importance score ranging from 0 to 5.\n",
      "\n",
      "Starting with 子宮 (しきゅう). The reading is \"shikyū\" and the importance score is 0. I know that 子 can mean child or son, and 宮 typically refers to a palace. However, when combined as 子宮, it usually means uterus in medical terms. Medical vocabulary is specialized, so unless the user is focusing on biology or healthcare Japanese, this might not be immediately useful for general learners. Therefore, I think 子宮 should be classified as Not-important.\n",
      "\n",
      "Next is 宫 (みや). The reading here is \"miya\" and the importance score is 2. The kanji 宮 by itself means palace, but in modern usage, it's less common except in certain contexts like 帝王(たいおう) which refers to emperors or in historical terms. However, I remember that 宫 can also be part of compound words, such as 皇室 (くわいち) meaning imperial family. Additionally, 宫 is sometimes read as \"きゅう\" in compounds like 結婚 (けつこん) where it's not directly used, but the kanji itself is less frequently encountered. The score of 2 suggests it's somewhat important but perhaps not top priority. Since there are higher-priority kanji to learn, I might consider this as Not-important too.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, but the user mentioned that at least one word should be important to cover the most crucial reading. Looking back, 子宫 is a compound with both kanji, so if we're focusing on each individual kanji separately, maybe 宫 (miya) should be considered for its primary reading. However, since the importance score is 2 and it's not extremely high, I might still lean towards Not-important unless there's another factor.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. The user wants to separate words based on their usefulness. 子宫 being a medical term is probably less common for general learners, while 宫 as a single kanji might have limited usage outside of specific contexts. Both scores are low, so maybe both should go into Not-important.\n",
      "\n",
      "But wait, the user's instruction says that at least one word should be important to learn the most important reading. If we consider each kanji separately, 子 is part of many words and might be more important than 宫. However, in this case, 子宫 is a single word with a score of 0, so perhaps it's better to keep both as Not-important since they're not high priority.\n",
      "\n",
      "I think I'll proceed by putting both into the Not-important list because their importance scores are low and they don't seem essential for basic vocabulary acquisition. This way, the user can focus on more critical kanji first before moving on to these.\n",

      "First, the task is to create flashcards for kanji and words. Some words are learned right after the kanji, others later. The key is to decide which ones to learn immediately based on their utility and importance in representing the main readings of the kanji.\n",
      "\n",
      "Looking at the word given: 渋い (しぶい, 3). The kanji here is 清 or maybe another one? Wait, no, the reading is しぶい. I think the kanji for this word is 清 because that's a common kanji with multiple readings. Let me confirm. Yes, 清 can be read as せい and すい. So in this case, 渋い uses the すい reading.\n",
      "\n",
      "The importance score is 3 out of 5. The user mentioned that it's acceptable for less important kanji to have less important words, but at least one word should always be important to learn the most crucial reading.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, I need to assess whether this word is useful and represents an important reading. 清 as a kanji is quite common, used in words like 清水 (せいすい) or 清掃 (せいそう). The せい reading is definitely more prominent than すい. So the しぶい reading might be less common.\n",
      "\n",
      "Given that the score is 3, which is moderately important but not top priority, I need to decide if this word should be learned immediately after the kanji or later. Since it's a lower importance score and the main readings of 清 are more likely せい-based words, this word might be better suited for later study.\n",
      "\n",
      "Therefore, I would categorize 渋い (しぶい, 3) as not-important because there are other higher priority words that better represent the primary readings of its kanji. It's better to focus on the more common and important readings first before moving on to less frequent ones like this.\n",

      "First, I should understand the criteria. Words that are learned directly after a kanji should be those that are useful and represent important readings. If a word isn't useful or doesn't show an important reading, it goes into \"Not-important.\" Also, each kanji must have at least one important word to learn its most crucial reading.\n",
      "\n",
      "Looking at 放棄 (ほうき), the kanji is '放' and '棄'. The reading is ほうき. The importance score is 1. I know that 'ほうき' means \"desertion\" or \" abandonment.\" This is a useful term in both formal and some informal contexts, especially related to things like giving up on something or leaving someone.\n",
      "\n",
      "Considering the importance score of 1, which is low but not zero, it might still be considered important because it's a common enough word. However, I should verify if this is one of the primary readings for '放' or '棄.' \n",
      "\n",
      "The kanji '放' primarily means \"let go\" or \"release,\" and in 放棄, it combines with '棄' meaning \"abandon.\" This combination makes 'ほうき' a standard reading. Since it's a compound word that teaches both kanji together, it might be essential for learners to grasp this reading.\n",

      "Looking at each word:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. 諸君 (しょくん, 1): This is read as \"shokun.\" The score here is 1, which seems low. I'm not sure how common this term is. It might be a name or a less frequent reading of the kanji combination. Since the importance score is low, it's probably better to learn later.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. 君 (きみ, 5): This is \"kimi\" and has a high importance score of 5. \"Kimi\" is a very common word meaning \"you\" in Japanese, especially in spoken language. It's crucial for understanding basic conversations. Definitely important.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. 君達 (きみたち, 3): This is read as \"kimichida\" or \"kimitachi,\" which means \"you all.\" The score here is 3, which is still on the higher side but not as high as 5. It's useful for plural reference but might be a bit more advanced than just \"君.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "4. 君 (くん, 5): This reading is \"くん.\" It's another way to read the same kanji and is often used in names or titles. However, it's less common in everyday speech compared to \"きみ.\" Despite the high score, it might not be as immediately useful for basic understanding.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, considering the user’s note: For less important kanji, it's acceptable to have fewer important words, but at least one word should always be important to cover the most important reading. \n",
      "\n",
      "Looking at the kanji 君 (きみ/kun), the primary readings are きみ and くん. \"きみ\" is essential for everyday language, so that should definitely be in Important. As for 諸君 (しょくん), it's less common, so it can go into Not-important.\n",
      "\n",
      "君達 (きみたち) is also important but perhaps a bit more advanced than just 君. Depending on priority, maybe it's better to include it later if we want to focus on the most essential first. However, since its score is 3, which isn't too low, it might still be considered important.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, I need to clarify: The user wants words that are learned directly after the kanji to be only those that are useful and represent important readings. So for each kanji, we should pick the most essential word(s). \n",
      "\n",
      "君 appears in multiple words. \"きみ\" is more essential than \"くん\" or \"きみたち.\" Therefore, 君 (きみ) should be in Important. The other forms can be in Not-important.\n",
      "\n",
      "诸君 is a separate word with its own kanji combination but has the lowest importance score, so it's safe to place it in Not-important as well.\n",

      "So final classification:\n",
      "Important: 君 (きみ)\n",
      "Not-important: 諸君 (しょくん), 君達 (きみたち), 君 (くん)\n",

      "For \"小銭,\" it's a compound of 小 and 銭. It means \"small coins\" or \"change.\" This is quite a common term in Japanese, especially when talking about money or giving change. So it seems useful and represents an important reading for the kanji 銭.\n",

      "Looking at each word:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **以前 (いぜん, 3)**: This means \"before\" or \"previously.\" The reading is いぜん, which is a common way to read the kanji. The score is 3, which is mid-level importance. Since it's a useful word and represents an important reading for the kanji 以前, I think it should be classified as Important.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **番 (ばん, 5)**: This can mean \"number\" or \"turn.\" It has multiple readings but here it's given as ばん with a high importance score of 5. High score suggests it's important for the kanji 番. So this should go into Important.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **一*つ (ひとつ, 4)**: The word is 一*つ, which is an old way to write \"one.\" It has a reading of ひとつ and a score of 4. Since it's a unique reading for the kanji 一, even though the word itself isn't super common anymore, its high score makes it important.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, considering the other words if there were any (though in this case, only three are provided), I'd have to evaluate each similarly. For each word, I check if learning it immediately would help with understanding the kanji's key readings. If it's useful and represents an important reading for that kanji, it goes into Important; otherwise, it's Not-important.\n",
      "\n",
      "So based on this reasoning:\n",
      "\n",
      "- 以前: Useful, common meaning, score is decent → Important.\n",
      "- 番: High score, important reading → Important.\n",
      "- 一*つ: Unique reading, high score → Important.\n",
      "\n",
      "There are no other words in the provided list, so all three go into Important. If there were more words, I'd apply the same logic to each.\n",
